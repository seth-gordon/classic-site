      <h1 class="text-center">Far more than you actually wanted to know about Gideon’s bar mitzvah</h1>
      <p class="lead text-center">(but hopefully we’ve answered all the questions that might come up)</p>
    <p>
      Written assuming you know practically nothing about bar mitzvahs
      or synagogues or bears, oh my!
    </p>
    <h2>Lodging</h2>
    <p>
      We’ve reserved a block of hotel rooms at the Embassy Suites
      Boston/Waltham.  You can check to see if any rooms in the block
      are still available by calling 1-800-EMBASSY or
      clicking <a href="http://embassysuites.hilton.com/en/es/groups/personalized/B/BOSWSES-GPY-20150703/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG">here</a>
      (the official deadline has passed, but you can still reserve
      rooms if they’re available).
    </p>
    <p>
      The hotel is about a 20-minute drive away from the synagogue.
      We chose this over the hotels closer to the city so that
      out-of-town guests could have suite-level amenities at a
      reasonable price, and so that they can drive from the synagogue
      to the hotel on the afternoon of July 4 without dealing with
      fireworks-related traffic or road closures. (Speaking of which,
      if you want to experience some celebratory events in
      Boston <em>other than</em> Gideon’s bar mitzvah, you can find
      suggestions <a href="http://www.boston-discovery-guide.com/boston-harborfest.html">here</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>If you are shomer shabbat</b> and therefore need a place to stay in walking distance of the synagogue, please let us know, and we will try to match you up with someone.  Our area of Brighton has <a href="http://bostoneruv.org/">an eruv</a> that includes Brookline and Newton.
    </p>
    <h2>The synagogue</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.kadimahtorasmoshe.org">Congregation
      Kadimah-Toras Moshe</a> (KTM), located at 113 Washington Street
      in Brighton (near the corner of Washington Street and
      Commonwealth Avenue) is a small Orthodox synagogue.
    </p>
    <h3>Some points of etiquette</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Men and women are seated separately for prayer, with a room
	divider (mechitza).  With a few exceptions, only Jewish males
	age 13 and up take part in running services.  Unless you are the
	first to arrive, it should be immediately obvious which side is
	which.  Siddurim (prayer books) and chumashim (Bibles) are
	available on the shelves immediately inside the sanctuary doors.
      </li>
      <li>
	Men (even non-Jewish men) should have their heads covered with
	a kippah (yarmulke, skullcap) or a hat approriate for a place
	of worship.  Kippot will be available in a basket in the
	lobby.  Jewish men may wear taleisim (prayer shawls) or not,
	according to their tradition, but you must wear one if you are
	participating in the liturgy or given a synagogue honor.
      </li>
      <li>
	It is the norm in our synagogue for married women to wear a
	hat or other hair covering, but not to wear a kippah or a
	tallis.  However, you should do what works for you.
      </li>
      <li>
	Dress is business-casual or better, and modest appropriate for
	the wearer’s age and respect for a place of worship.  For men,
	jackets and/or ties are common but not universal.  Most adult
	women wear the sort of skirts and blouses you would wear to be
	a secretary in an office with periodic client contact, and
	flat shoes; some wear more formal businesswear, and some wear
	pantsuits. Kids wear whatever their parents can convince them to wear.
      </li>
      <li>
	In order to enhance our members’ concentration on the holiness of the Sabbath day, please silence your cell phone and do not use it, or cameras, or similar equipment, on the synagogue grounds, even before and after service times. Smoking is not allowed in or near the synagogue building.
      </li>
      <li>
	Children can play, hang out, and participate in a children’s
	service upstairs.  There are no babysitters; children should
	be supervised to a level appropriate to their age.  Adults who
	are feeling bored with services tend to hang out either
	upstairs or outside.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Getting there</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Driving</dt>
      <dd>Point your GPS (or cabbie) to 113 Washington Street, Brighton, MA.</dd>
      <dt>Public transportation</dt>
      <dd>Take the B line to the Washington Street stop, or take the #65 bus to the corner of Washington Street and Euston Street.  Continue walking northwest; the synagogue will be on your right.</dd>
      <dt>Walking</dt>
      <dd>Ask your hosts, or walk along with them.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Parking</h3>
    <p>
      While KTM has a small parking lot, it is typically closed and blocked off on the Sabbath; children often play ball in the lot.  If you are shomer Shabbat, and your host does not have a driveway or easily accessible non-resident parking, let us know and we will arrange for you to park in the KTM lot before Shabbat begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, Brighton has a variety of street parking locations
      around the synagogue.  <span class="bg-primary">A link to
      an <em>approximate</em> map of the area’s parking will go
      here.</span> Please read the signage carefully; most streets
      have a combination of visitor parking and resident-sticker-only
      parking.
    </p>
    <h2>Schedule</h2>
    <h3>Friday night</h3>
    <p>
      Candle-lighting for Shabbat is at 8:06 p.m.  During the summer,
      however, KTM holds Kabbalat Shabbat and Ma`ariv services at 7:00
      p.m.  Gideon will not be leading any of those, nor will he be
      speaking.  We will, however, be hosting a Shabbat dinner after
      services for out-of-town guests and their hosts.  Dinner is
      unlikely to be served until about 8:30 p.m.  Family members are
      welcome to either join us for this late dinner, or have their
      own meal earlier and stop by for dessert and to say hello.  If
      you are coming for dinner or dessert, please let us know when
      you respond to the invitation.
    </p>
    <h3>Saturday morning services</h3>
    <p>
      Shacharit begins at 8:45 a.m., but Gideon won’t be doing much of
      anything interesting until about 9:15 a.m.  If you are familiar
      with an Orthodox or traditional-Conservative service, all you
      need to know is that Gideon will be leyning the entire parsha,
      reading the haftarah, and leading musaf.  If you are not so
      familiar, see <a href="shacharit.html">here</a> for a
      description of what will happen and what Gideon’s role will be.
    </p>
    <h3>Lunch following services</h3>
    <p>
      We'll ask guests to move out of the way or to help as we move
      chairs to the side and set up some tables for a
      Fourth-of-July-themed kiddush luncheon with the KTM
      community. Once you've re-entered the room, please wait until
      someone has made kiddush (the blessing over grape juice). If
      it's too loud, or you don't know how on earth you'd recognize
      kiddush even if it was said in your ear, then as a practical
      matter, take a general “amen!” as a cue to get yourself some
      lunch. If it is your tradition to wash ritually before eating
      bread, the sinks are in the rear corner of the women's section.
    </p>
    <p>
      After people have had a chance to get a little food, Gideon will
      speak about his Torah portion, and one or more parents will
      speak. Lunch will conclude with bentsching (grace after meals)
      at some point. Where timing is vague because people will hang
      out as long as they like, and leave as they need to leave.
    </p>
    <h3>The rest of the afternoon</h3>
    <p>
      Many guests will now disperse to home or hotel. Those who are
      shomer shabbas or who otherwise want to hang out (particularly
      if it's hot and the air-conditioned building is appealing) are
      invited to stay at the shul for board games or social time. We
      may also head for a local park/playground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rabbi holds a class late Saturday afternoon either in the
      synagogue or in a local park, followed by mincha services,
      seudah shlishit, and maariv. Havdallah (the end of Shabbat) will
      be at about 9:10 pm. (I'm not actually looking that up, so check
      the shul bulletin for the exact time.)
    </p>
    <h3>The rest of the weekend</h3>
    <p>
      July 4, the day of Gideon’s bar mitzvah, is in the Hebrew
      calendar <a href="http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/479885/jewish/About-the-17th-of-Tammuz.htm">the 17th of Tammuz</a>,
      a fast day commemorating the breaching of the walls of the city
      of Jerusalem by the Babylonians, and later the Romans. (The
      date's historical accuracy is doubtful, but the day was chosen
      several thousand years ago to commemorate several unhappy events
      in Jewish history.) The 17th of Tammuz marks the start of three
      weeks of solemness-transitioning-into-mourning leading up to the
      9th of Av (Tisha B’Av), which commemorates the destruction,
      twice, of the Temple in Jerusalem, a structure which remains
      un-rebuilt to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the holiness of the Sabbath, we don't fast on it, but
      the restrictions of the Three Weeks begin at havdallah. There
      will be no separate bar mitzvah party as a result (Gideon will
      have gotten together with his friends and age-mates for a party
      in June, before everyone went off for camp or summer
      travels.). For those not observing Shabbat or the Three Weeks,
      we can recommend the Esplanade fireworks. The Pops begin their
      concert at 8 pm, and the fireworks run from 10:30-11 pm. In
      other years, when July 4th does not coincide with the Three
      Weeks, we've taken the kids via the T (green line, right by the
      synagogue) to the Copley stop and walked toward the
      Esplanade. Storrow Drive (indeed, pretty much all the roads and
      bridges in the area of the river) is closed to traffic and we
      have generally stood with the kids at the jersey barrier to hear
      the concert (on the speakers) and see the fireworks (low shots
      will be blocked by the trees). It is also possible to cross over
      right to the Esplanade itself, though we haven't generally
      bothered, and it's crazy-crowded, with the best spaces going to
      those who arrive in the wee hours of the morning and stay most
      of the day. It takes approximately an hour to get from Brighton
      to the fireworks, and about the same to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday, we will be observing the (postponed from Shabbat)
      fast day. A Jewish fast day is dawn to nightfall, no food, no
      water, so especially if it's hot we'll be disinclined to
      socialize much. The fast ends at around 9 pm. We'd be happy to
      get together with any out-of-town family that is still around on
      Monday or Tuesday or later in the week, though!
