	<h1>What to expect at shacharit</h1>
	<p>
	  This is a normal Shabbat service at which Gideon will take
	  his place in the community as a bar mitzvah, a Jewish adult
	  male, newly eligible to take on liturgical leadership roles
	  (in addition to adult responsibility for his religious
	  life). Services begin at 8:45 am, but Gideon won't be doing
	  much of anything interesting until about 9:15 a.m., so if
	  you're running a bit late, don't fret. (If you've been
	  honored with a part in the liturgy, please arrive on the
	  earlier side.) Because many people–including most of
	  Gideon's friends and classmates–will be away for the
	  summer, there should be no problem getting a good
	  seat. Services will run until shortly after noon.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Yes, that's very long. Particularly if you don't feel
	  comfortable with Hebrew. Oh, didn't we mention the service
	  is conducted almost entirely in Hebrew? Except for the
	  Aramaic bits. The siddurim (prayerbooks) have facing-page
	  English translation, as do the chumashim (bibles), and page
	  numbers are periodically called out.  (The synagogue has
	  siddurim and chumashim from several different publishers,
	  and each has different pagination.  The black siddurim are
	  “Artscroll”, the bluish grey are “Koren”, and the deep blue
	  are “Birnbaum”.  The chumashim with embossed covers are
	  “Artscroll” a.k.a. “Stone”, and the ones with the flat cloth
	  covers are “Hertz”.  When the leaders call out page numbers,
	  they should say “page such-and-such in the Stone chumash,
	  page so-and-so in the Hertz”; if they forget, you can ask a
	  neighbor to help you find your place.)
	</p>
	<p>
	  So given that it's long, and in a language you probably
	  don't speak, you may find yourself fidgety. People are
	  people, so sometimes people chat a little, but if you want
	  to have an extended conversation, or need to stretch your
	  legs, or whatever, feel free to step out. You'll see people
	  going in and out pretty much throughout, and doing a wide
	  variety of things. Jen will be popping in and out of the
	  sanctuary, lobby, and kitchen. (Seth's got to stay by his
	  post.) Latecomers may sit down and join the services at
	  whatever point the community's at, or may catch up on their
	  own prayers quietly, putting them temporarily out of sync
	  with whatever the rest of the community's doing, so while
	  everyone else is sitting, you may see one or two people
	  standing for prayers, or vice-versa. If you don't know what
	  to do, go with whatever the bulk of the congregation seems
	  to be doing.
	</p>
	<p>
	  An architectural note. The room's divided into male and
	  female sections by a room-divider that at the time of this
	  writing was badly in need of a dusting. That's been true for
	  years, so will probably will still be true in July. The
	  men's section is where the liturgical action takes
	  place. There is a large table that serves as a lectern to
	  support the prayer leader's book(s) and, in the center of
	  the service, the sefer Torah. This scroll is written on
	  parchment (yes, real sheepskin) and is completely
	  handwritten by a trained scribe with special ink using a
	  quill (yes, a feather). The Torah is written completely in
	  Hebrew, a language that traditionally has no written
	  vowels. If you look at your siddur or your chumash, you'll
	  see in the Hebrew side lots of dots and squiggles that
	  indicate vocalization and musical intonation. None of this
	  information appears in the scroll, and must be learned by
	  memory by the scroll's reader (in this case, Gideon).
	</p>
	<p>
	  Behind the large table-like object (bimah, it's called) is a
	  raised platform where the rabbi and synagogue president sit,
	  and a closet-like structure called an aron (ark). Notice the
	  ner tamid (eternal flame, though it's really an electric
	  lamp, because um, fire hazard) hanging nearby. The Torah
	  scrolls are stored in the ark. Some guests will recognize in
	  these building features the parent-structures of church
	  architectural elements. The plaques on the walls have been
	  purchased (donation to support the synagogue) in memory of a
	  deceased family member; those with lit bulbs nearby are in
	  the week of the anniversary (yahrzeit) of their passing.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <i>Stand or sit?</i> In general, you're safe doing what the
	  majority of the people around you are doing. The only real
	  rules are that the congregation stands for the silent part
	  of the Amidah; the early parts of the Amidah repetition; and
	  when the ark doors are open (which is why I'm mentioning
	  this now, after the architectural tour). Oh, and for
	  kaddishes. Some of which are said as liturgical section
	  breaks, others of which are said by those mourning a recent
	  death or observing a yahrzeit.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The service itself begins at 8:45 am with a litany of things
	  for which we bless God for every day (For example: “Blessed
	  are You, G-d, King of the Universe, who straightens the
	  bent” – a blessing meaningful to those of us whose joints
	  pop and creak as we get out of bed in the morning.),
	  followed by a series of more or less musical (depending on
	  the leader) hymns of praise to God, mostly taken from the
	  book of Tehillim (Psalms). Most people are still straggling
	  in during this time.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We transition into the main section of the service with a
	  call to prayer (barechu), followed by blessings
	  acknowledging G-d for creation (particularly daytime) and
	  for His particular care of the Jewish people. At the center
	  of this section is the reading of the Sh'ma (“Hear O Israel,
	  the Lord your God, the Lord is One.”) followed by key
	  sections from the Torah. Part of these sections appear in
	  the mezuzah on the doorposts and in tefillin (phyllacteries)
	  as well. After the Sh'ma are additional praises of G-d,
	  followed by the Amidah (“standing prayer”).
	</p>
	<p>
	  During this prayer the congregation stands (hence the name)
	  and prays silently. You should avoid chatting and walking in
	  and out of the sanctuary immediately before and certainly
	  during this time. If praying the words in the siddur don't
	  appeal to you, you can use the time to stand quietly and
	  meditate, or flip through the book, or count the ceiling
	  tiles. According to the Yerushalmi Talmud, Rabbi Bun bar
	  Hiyyah used to count the bricks of the wall opposite him, so
	  you won't be the first. Sit when the bulk of the people
	  around you sit.
	</p>
	<p>
	  When most of the congregation has finished the silent
	  Amidah, the prayer leader will launch into a repetition of
	  this prayer aloud. During one part (“kedusha”) the
	  congregation stands and participates in a call-and-response
	  format, including some bouncing up onto the toes at various points. Excellent opportunity to stretch those calf muscles, or to just standing still, if those points don't hold religious meaning for you. Some guests will recognize in various liturgical
	  parts the parents of their own liturgical traditions.
	</p>
	<p>
	  At this point, Gideon or someone else will take the Torah
	  scroll out of the ark with some musical pomp, and it will be
	  unrolled to the correct place. Multiple men (they'll know
	  who they are ahead of time, unless someone who has priority
	  in Jewish law needs to cut in) will be called up for an
	  “aliyah”, an honor in which they say the blessing over that
	  section of the Torah reading, and Gideon will read the
	  relevant section. Several men will stand on either side of
	  the bimah/table checking his reading against a printed book
	  for correctness.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Gideon's Hebrew birthday occurred during the week of the
	  reading “Balak” (Numbers 22:2–25:9), which features the
	  famous donkey who mouthed off at its owner Bilaam, a
	  Mesopotamian prophet and sorcerer hired by King Balak to
	  curse the Jewish people's military campaign toward and into
	  Canaan. That's what set the date of his bar mitzvah, btw,
	  not the convenient holiday weekend.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Among the men to be called up for the Torah reading will be
	  Seth, who will say the traditional father's blessing
	  thanking God for his son becoming an
	  adult-within-Judaism. Gideon will have the last (maftir)
	  aliyah and will be called up with some fuss for it (it'll be
	  his first time), say the blessings for the reading, chant
	  from the scroll, and say the ending blessings.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The men honored with hagbah and g'lilah will be called up to
	  lift and display (hagbah) the last part of the reading in
	  the scroll. Note that the scroll weighs between 30 and 40
	  lbs. He will be assisted by a second man who will roll
	  (g'lilah) the vertically held scroll closed and wrap it.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Then Gideon will say the blessings for and read the
	  haftarah, a section from the Prophets (Micah 5:6–6:8, a
	  reading in which God protests the Jewish people's failure to
	  observe the Torah as He intended, and reminds them of all
	  He's done for them, including His foiling the plot of Balak
	  and Bilaam). He will chant from a book that has the Hebrew
	  marked up with vowels and musical notes. Here, the same
	  symbols as are used for the Torah reading (in printed books)
	  have a different musical tune/intonation. He'll chant the
	  blessings after the haftarah. At some point in all this, you
	  will have been given a piece of candy. When Gideon's
	  finished the haftarah blessings, it'll be time to yell mazel
	  tov! And throw the candy at him. Yes, AT him. Kids will run
	  to get the candy, and then their parents can tell them not
	  to eat so much, sugar's not good for them.
	</p>
	<p>
	  At this point, either Gideon or someone else will transition
	  into the last part of the service, mussaf, by putting the
	  Torah scroll back in the ark (with song and a bit of a
	  parade). The rabbi will probably speak briefly at this
	  point, as rabbis often feel the need to do (Gideon will
	  speak during the luncheon), and services will continue with
	  the Mussaf Amidah, which is again a prayer for which the
	  congregation stands silently, and is repeated, with some
	  additions, by the prayer leader. The service closes with
	  some songs, possibly led by Gideon's younger brothers. <a href="index.html">Back to the main info page.</a>
