<h2>C is for Chance
</h2>

Many people criticize state lotteries as "a tax on people bad at
math", a program that takes more from the poor than from the rich, and
a way for the government to have a vested interest in compulsive
gambling.  However, in New Holstein, the lottery is none of these
things; instead, it is a bulwark of social stability.  Not only are
its payouts generous, but participation is mandatory.
