<h2>A Policy Wonk's Alphabet of Dreams</h2>

At the dawn of the twenty-first century, the human race sinks into
a cultural war that one writer called "Jihad vs. McWorld".  On the one
side, government-sponsored sexism, suicide bombers, and lies; on the
other, multiple-choice education, property rights &uuml;ber alles,
and lies.
<p>
In the hope that our species is capable of more than that, I hereby
offer some alternative lies, from my travels in countries of the
imagination.

<ul>
<li><a href="anonymous.html">A is for Anonymous:</a>
Come to the place where nobody needs to know your name.
<li><a href="beauty.html">B is for Beautiful:</a>
How much is your face worth to you?
</ul>
