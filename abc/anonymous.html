<h2>A is for Anonymous</h2>

In the <em>United Nations Statistical Handbook</em>, the entry for
Vespucci Island has no entry for "population".  Nor does it say
anything about the country's Gross Domestic Product, its fertility
rate, its literacy rate, or a dozen other statistics.  The Vespuccian
government, bound by a constitution with the world's strictest privacy
clauses, maintains no such information about its population, and
Vespuccian citizens are proud of their government's ignorance.
<p>
All Vespuccian citizens have the right to keep their biometric
information (their photographs, fingerprints, retina prints, etc.)
strictly apart from their financial information (their assets,
debts, account numbers, etc.).  A Vespuccian driver's license has a
photograph of its owner, an inscription certifying "this person is
licensed to drive any automobile under such-and-such a weight", and
all the other usual accoutrements of driver's licenses -- but no name.
A Vespuccian can open a bank account anywhere in the country without
providing any kind of identification, using any name that he or she
wishes.  (Indeed, ever since the Vespuccians discovered the
cryptographic algorithms for "digital cash", any citizen with a PC can
form his or her own bank.)  Vespuccian passports do have both
photographs and names, but only because other countries refused to
accept anonymous passports.  In practice, those passports have
whimsical names and improbable birthdays.
<p>
Even when ignorant of its citizens' lives, the Vespuccian government
manages to collect money from them.  Its chief sources of revenue are
the property tax, the weight tax, and the heat tax.  All of these
taxes are tied to parcels of real estate, and charged to the
property's owner of record.  Interest on late payments is stiff, and
delinquent property is seized without mercy.  The property tax works
much like it does in any other country: even when a house's purchaser
of record is a bank-account number, the price must be recorded with
the government in order for the sale to be valid.  Factories,
warehouses, and retail stores have to record the weight of all goods
they bring in for processing or sale, and pay an excise tax on the
weight.  The heat tax is based on the temperature of the waste water
coming out of a building, and on satellite images showing the
temperature of the surrounding air.
<p>
Both a progressive income tax and a traditional welfare system are
impossible on Vespucci Island.  There is no way to tell, by inspecting
a bank's records, the difference between five poor depositors and one
rich depsitor using five aliases.  However, the government does pay a
monthly stipend, sufficient for food and shelter, to every citizen who
wants one.  On the first day of the month, you can show up at your
local Welfare Office and have your picture taken.  If the picture
does not match any file photographs of foreign visitors, or of people
who have visited the Welfare Office earlier on the same day, then you
can receive your stipend as cash, or as a check made out to the name
of your choice.  At the end of the day, the file of photographs used
to prevent double-dipping is erased.
<p>
The Vespuccians' adoption of digital cash has created a few challenges
for its law-enforcement officials.  In one famous case, a kidnapper
posted his PGP public key on the Internet, and demanded that the
ransom money be posted, as digital cash, encrypted with that key.
Since anybody on the Net could read the message, but only the
kidnapper had the secret key that would decrypt it, there was no way
to trace where the money went.  However, the detective on the case
posted his own public key, and announced that whoever supplied the
kidnapper's location would be handsomely and untraceably rewarded.
To this day, not even the police know who submitted the detailed map
of the kidnappers' hideout and the meticulous report of their daily
schedule.
<p>
As various money-laundering interests sought alternatives to
Switzerland and the Caymans, some alighted on Vespucci Island, and
the attention of larger countries' governments followed them.  After
acrimonious debate, the legislature
made an exception to its privacy laws: Any foreigner bringing
currency onto Vespuccian territory, or purchasing it with Vespuccian
money at the central bank, would have his or her picture
posted on the government's Web site.  This was not quite what Interpol
had wanted, but it was enough to satisfy them.
