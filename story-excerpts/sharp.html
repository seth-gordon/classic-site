<p class="p6"><a id="doc6"></a>Oliver met Fennel on the first afternoon of the Blood of Christ Family Retreat. By the time they had both unpacked their bags, they had already run through the questions that fourteen-year-old strangers always ask each other: <span class="s1">Where do you live? What church do you go to? What school? Is your mother a sharp, or your father?</span></p>
<p class="p7">The next day, as the older flats (Fennel’s father; Oliver’s mother) were eating their third bowls of spaghetti with meatballs, Fennel tapped Oliver on the shoulder. “Hey,” she said. “Are you full? Do you want to get some fresh air before dessert?”</p>
<p class="p7">Oliver swallowed the half-meatball in his mouth without chewing it, and then followed the girl out of the cafeteria. In spite of the July humidity, some middle-school kids were playing basketball on the asphalt court; others huddled in the gazebo, watching each other play video games. Fennel sauntered past both groups. The path ran beside a long tile-walled building, which held bathrooms, showers, and feeding stalls. “I have to go,” Fennel said, and darted inside.</p>
<p class="p7">The two of them were the only people in the bathhouse. After pacing the central corridor twice from end to end, Oliver entered one of the feeding stalls. An hour after lunch, there would be a line for the room, sharps waiting to take nourishment from their flat spouses, parents, or siblings.</p>
<p class="p7">High, screened windows along one wall gave light and ventilation. The atmosphere in the stall felt hot and stuffy, with the trace of a bitter tang. The graffiti-covered feeding chair’s two seats were side by side, but facing in opposite directions; an S-shaped rail served as the backrest and armrest for both seats.</p>
<p class="p7">Oliver sat in the chair and rested an elbow against the rail. Someone had printed a message along it with a red permanent marker: <span class="s1">Vinny U feed my SOUL forEVER! love, Ursula.</span></p>
<p class="p7">The stall door creaked. Oliver sprang to his feet.</p>
