<h2>How to Speak Your Native Language</h2>

Even if you are a monolingual American, at some point in your life,
you will probably meet someone who doesn't understand spoken English
very well -- either because they have a different native language, or
because they depend on lip-reading to understand speech.  The
traditional way for native speakers to deal with this situation is to
speak slowly, loudly, and perhaps even ungrammatically.  Here are some
(I hope) more practical tips, based on my experience misunderstanding
native speakers of Spanish, Hebrew, and American Sign Language.
<ul>
<li><b>Pause between phrases, and between sentences, longer than you
normally would.</b> As an intermediate-level language student listening
to natives, one of my great frustrations was understanding what
someone said a few seconds <em>after</em> he or she said it -- by
which point the topic of conversation had already shifted to something
else.  It's not always enough to speak slowly, because sometimes the
"last piece of the puzzle" that helps you understand a whole sentence comes
at the end.
<li><b>Judge non-native listeners' comprehension by what they actually
say in response, not just by how much they nod and say "Yes".</b>
For the language student, just as understanding is a delayed reaction,
so is the realization of how much one <em>failed</em> to understand.
Meanwhile, it is hard to resist the urge to smile, nod, and otherwise
fake comprehension, while the meaning of the smile fades from "I
understand pretty much what you mean, so the three words I missed
don't matter" to "I understand the general
topic of the conversation" to "Maybe if I keep listening I'll figure
out enough to catch up" to "I'm too embarrassed to admit that I haven't
understood a word you said for the last five minutes".
<li><b>If someone doesn't understand what you said, rephrase it,
don't just repeat it.</b> They may not understand because they don't
know what certain words or idioms mean, or because the way you
pronounce a word doesn't match the way they learned it, or because
they can't even get a grip on where one word of your sentence ends and
the next one begins.  Repeating the same sentence in different terms
gives them a fresh chance to figure things out.
<li><b>Remember that someone's level of foreign-language comprehension
depends on what's being talked about.</b> Don't extrapolate from
someone's language skill in one context to overestimate their skill in
a different context. An immigrant child who seems perfectly competent
with English on the schoolyard may not be able to follow the sort of
English used by the math teacher in class lectures.  I can do a
passable job reading the Hebrew of medieval Talmudic commentaries, but
when I tried to read a translation of Isaac Asimov's
<cite>Foundation</cite>, I gave up within three pages.
<li><b>Pay attention to how visible your face is.</b> This is
especially important, of course, if you're dealing with someone who
reads lips, but even non-native English speakers with perfect hearing
will understand you better if they see your face as you talk.  In
particular, make sure you're not back-lit.
<li><b>Don't yell at lip-readers.</b> First, if all they
needed to understand your words was more volume, they could turn up
their hearing aids.  Second, since the mouth movements of
<em>spoken</em> English are not the mouth movements of
<em>shouted</em> English, shouting may actually make your speech less
comprehensible.  If you must raise your voice, try <em>projecting</em>
it, like a stage actor.
</li>
