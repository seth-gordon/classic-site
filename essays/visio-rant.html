<h2>Visio -- USER SURLINESS for the TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY</h2>

So, our group does a lot of diagrams with little icons and lines
between them, and when I make these diagrams, I usually do them in
either FrameMaker or PowerPoint, which is kind of a pain.
<p>
I heard about Visio, which is supposed to be the eight-hundred-pound
gorilla of diagramming software. Think of Visio as MacDraw on
STEROIDS, or AutoCAD in two dimensions and embedding VISUAL BASIC
instead of a REAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.
<p>
Visio uses "stencils" of various standard shapes with standard
behaviors.  You can create documents by dragging the shapes you need
(flowchart boxes, architectural symbols, UML arrows, whatever), from
the appropriate stencil.  You can create your own stencil full of
shapes of your own design.  Or, you can use one of the dozens of
stencils that come with Visio.  The more you pay Visio, the more
stencils you get.  Welcome to "market segmentation".
<p>
I have yet to plumb the depths of the Visio's immense power,
flexibility, and configurability, but I have already established one
thing beyond all reasonable doubt:
<p>
The Visio user interface SUCKS.
<p>
You'd think that since this is a GRAPHICS program, the company would
employ some people who have a CLUE about VISUAL COMMUNICATION.  But
NOOOOOO.  They must be REFUGEES from the MICROSOFT OFFICE SCHOOL OF
INTERFACE DESIGN, and therefore, believe that if you give the user
toolbars and icons ALL OVER THE FRIGGING SCREEN, then you have a
graphical user interface.
<p>
Those poor UNIX WEENIES are stuck in the SIXTIES with CRYPTIC COMMANDS
like "rm", "ls", and "grep", while we Visio users are moving into the
TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY, with EASY-TO-UNDERSTAND ICONS like little green
boxes, little red boxes, little blue boxes, and little gray boxes --
the distinct meanings of which are scattered ALMOST AT RANDOM through
the <i>Using Visio Products</i> manual, two hundred and fifty pages of
brilliant BLACK AND WHITE.
<p>
Excerpts from my ADVENTURES thus far:
<p class="stb">
ITEM.
<p>
Everything on a stencil has its own little icon, as well as a name.  I
created my own little "customer account" circle and dragged it onto my
own little stencil, and it got its own icon--a circle on a gray
background.  Then I edited the circle to take out the border, and the
icon became flat gray--a GRAY BORDERLESS CIRCLE ON A GRAY BACKGROUND.
Well, gosh, that's HELPFUL.
<p>
Visio does let you edit a shape's icon with a MacPaint-style bitmap
editor.  But if you spend half an hour editing an icon, and then you
change the shape again, GUESS WHAT HAPPENS?  Right, Visio changes the
icon again.  That's just DOUBLE HELPFUL, ain't it?
<p class="stb">
ITEM.
<p>
By default, my workspace came up with a ruler marked off in inches.  I
decided I'd rather have a ruler marked off in points, especially since
I was editing half-inch-wide shapes in extreme close-up.  That should
be SIMPLE, right?  HA!
<p>
The "Ruler & Grid" command under the "Tools" menu lets you change the
coarseness of ruler subdivisions, but not the units of measure.  The
"Options" command lets you change the DEFAULT units of measure, but
didn't do SQUAT to the DOCUMENT I HAD OPEN IN FRONT OF ME.  Finally, I
discovered the actual field that sets those rulers, under...
<p>
...the "Page Properties" tab of the "Page Setup" dialog box.  In every
GUI-based program I've seen since the APPLE LISA came out, over
FIFTEEN YEARS ago, this dialog box only covered how things looked on
PAPER.  But clearly, I shouldn't let my years of experience with GUIs
affect where I look for controls on Visio; I should PROSTRATE MYSELF
before this KILLER APP and appreciate its MYSTERY.
<p>
And after doing all that, I got my ruler denominated in points, with
the major tick marks five points apart.  FIVE?  Do these programmers
think printer's points (72.27 pt = 1 in) are METRIC UNITS or
something?
<p class="stb">
ITEM.
<p>
I want to have a little icon shaped like an envelope, to represent a
street address.  So I did what I would do in PowerPoint or MacDraw:
take a box, take two lines, put the lines in the right place within
the box, and select the "Group" command.  Then came TROUBLE.
<p>
See, every shape in Visio can have a text field attached to it.  When
I clicked on my new, cleverly-grouped object, and then pushed the
appropriate button to enter text, I didn't get a text field centered
in the box; instead, I got a text field centered on the RIGHT DIAGONAL
LINE.  I recalled that in a certain dialog box, where you could
protect shapes from being moved or resized, you could also protect
them from being selected.  So I went to that dialog box, checked that
option, clicked "OK", and got this warning message:
<p>
"Shapes protected from selection can still be selected unless you
check Shapes in the Protect Document dialog box."
<p>
Umm ... So much for THAT idea.  OK.  MOVING RIGHT ALONG....  Maybe
it's time for me to READ THE EFFING MANUAL.
<p>
According to the manual: "When you select multiple shapes by
shift-clicking, the primary shape (A) is the first shape you select
... When you select shapes by dragging a selection net around them
[you know, the marching-ants rectangle], the primary shape (A) is the
one you dropped most recently on the page."
<p>
Well, THAT explains it.  Or does it?  Reading further: "When you type
in a group, the text appears on the frontmost shape in the stacking
order."
<p>
GOD FORBID that this program should behave CONSISTENTLY.
<p class="stb">
ITEM.
<p>
So I figured, OK, I want my text to appear in the center of the box,
so I have to put the box on top and the lines underneath.  That means
I have to change the fill pattern of the box from "white" to
"transparent".  So I ungroup the shapes, click on the box, select
"Fill" from the "Format" menu, and get a warning message:
<p>
"The document you are opening contains macros or customizations.  Some
macros may contain viruses that could harm your computer...."
<p>
Yes, that's right, ladies and gentlemen.  My RECTANGLE might have a
MACRO VIRUS.
