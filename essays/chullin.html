    <h1>Tractate Chullin, chapter 8</h1>
    <h2>Mishnah 1</h2>
    <blockquote class="mishnah">
      <p>It is forbidden to cook any meat with
    milk, except for the meat of fish and locusts.
      </p>
      <p>
	And it is forbidden to put it on the table, except for meat of
	fish and locusts.
      </p>
      <p>
	One who swears off meat is allowed to eat the meat of fish and
	locusts.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This implies that poultry is forbidden by the Torah, according to
      one who does not hold like Rabbi Akiva.  Because is not Rabbi
      Akiva the one who said, "Game and poultry are not [forbidden] from
      the Torah?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But note the last part: "One who swears off meat is allowed to
      eat the meat of fish and locusts".  We have arrived at the
      opinion of Rabbi Akiva, who said, "Any matters regarding which an
      agent would consult [the principal] are members of the category
      [given in the principal's instructions]".  For it was taught in
      a Baraita:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="baraita">
      <p>
	One who swears off vegetables is allowed to eat
	cucumbers, but Rabbi Akiva forbids it.
      </p>
      <p>
	They said to Rabbi
	Akiva: "If a man says to his agent, 'Get us some vegetables',
	might the agent not say, 'I only found cucumbers'?
      </p>
      <p>
	He said to them "Just so.  The agent would never say, 'I only
	found beans'.  Rather, cucumbers are included in 'vegetables',
	but beans are not included in 'vegetables'."
      </p>
    </blockquote> 
    <p>
      The first part is according to the Rabbis, but the last part is
      according to Rabbi Akiva.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rav Yosef said: "The mishnah is according to Rebbi, who quoted
      what he learned.  Regarding oaths, he holds like Rabbi Akiva.
      Regarding milk and meat, he holds like the Rabbis."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rav Ashi said: "All of the mishnah is according to Rabbi Akiva,
      and this is what he's saying: All meat is forbidden to be cooked
      with milk, whether it's defined as meat by the words of the
      Torah or by the words of the rabbis -- except for the meat of
      fish and locusts, which are defined as meat by neither the words
      of the Torah nor by the words of the rabbis.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <blockquote class="mishnah">
      And it is forbidden to put it on the table,...
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Rav Yosef said: "Learn from this that poultry with milk is
      forbidden by the Torah.  If it came into your mind that eating
      it was a rabbinic prohibition, that prohibition itself would be
      a fence around the Torah, and we prohibited putting on the table
      as a fence around eating."
    </p>
    <p>
      But why should you say that we do not place a fence around a
      fence?
    </p>
    <p>
      Because it was taught in another mishnah:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="mishnah">
      Challah outside of the Land is eaten with a non-Cohen at the
      table, and it is given to any Cohen who wants it.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      [Rashi: "to any Cohen who wants it", even an ignoramus who is
      not careful about ritual purity; this is not so regarding
      challah separated within Israel....]
    </p>
    <p>
      [Challah that is separated outside of Israel only has
      ritual-purity restrictions according to rabbinic law, as a
      fence.  Challah separated within Israel cannot be given to
      Cohanim who are ignoramuses, as another fence.  If challah
      separated outside of Israel could not be given to ignorant
      Cohanim, this would be a fence around a fence.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Abayye said to him: "This is all well and good if we interpret
      'challah outside of the Land' as meaning challah [that was
      separated outside of the Land and brought] within the Land of
      Israel, because there would be a reason to make a fence for that
      case, challah separated within Israel having Torah obligations
      associated with it.  However, [regarding challah that is both
      separated and eaten] outside of the Land, since there is no
      reason to make a fence [there would be no fence around a
      fence].  But in this case, if it were permitted to put poultry
      and cheese on the table, people would come to put meat and
      cheese on the table, and violate the Torah prohibition of eating
      meat with milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rav Sheshet challenged this: "Be that as it may, it's cold food
      with other cold food."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abayye said: "There is a fence lest they put it in a chafing
      dish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be that as it may, it's a <em>kli sheni</em>, and there is no
      cooking in a <em>kli sheni</em>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather, there is a fence lest they put it in a chafing dish
      that was a <em>kli rishon</em>."
    </p>
    <h2>Mishnah 2</h2>
    <blockquote class="mishnah">
      "Poultry is placed with cheese on the table and not eaten",
      says the House of Shammai.  And the House of Hillel says, "It is
      not placed on the table and it is not eaten".  Rabbi Yosi says,
      "This is one of the leniencies of the House of Shammai and the
      stringencies of the House of Hillel."  What table does this
      apply to?  One at which people eat.  But on a table where the
      cooked foods are being arranged, they put this next to that and
      nobody is concerned.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Rabbi Yosi and the Tanna Kamma [the anonymous author of the
      first part of the Mishnah] have redundant
      opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose you were to say that eating is the issue that they
      disagree on, since the Tanna Kamma is saying that [the
      Houses of Hillel and Shammai] are (a) arguing about putting
      things on the table, and (b) <em>not</em> arguing about eating.
      Then Rabbi Yosi says that eating itself is one of the leniencies
      of the House of Shammai and the stringencies of the House of Hillel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But behold, it was taught <strike>in a Baraita</strike>:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="mishnah">
      Rabbi Yosi says: "There are six issues among the leniencies of
      the House of Shammai and the stringencies of the House of
      Hillel, and this is one of them: 'Poultry is placed with cheese
      on the table and not eaten', says the House of Shammai, and the
      House of Hillel says, 'It is not placed on the table and it is
      not eaten'."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Rather, this is what it's teaching us: the Tanna Kamma
      <em>is</em> Rabbi Yosi.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="mishnah">
      Anyone who speaks a thing in the name of the one who said it
      brings salvation to the world, as it is said:
      <blockquote class="ketuvim">
	And Esther spoke to the king in the name of
	Mordechai...
