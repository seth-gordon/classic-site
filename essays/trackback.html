<h2>Notes on the Background of Back-Links</h2>

<p class="mtb"> <h3>In the Beginning was the Link</h3>
Every click on a hyperlink sends a message with a return address.
That address, the <em>referrer</em>, is the URL of the page containing
the link.  It is also a compromise between two different visions of
hypertext.
<p>
When Tim
Berners-Lee was designing the protocols for the World-Wide Web, one
issue he contemplated was: <a
href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Topology.html#14">Should links be
one-way or two-way?</a> On the one hand, since a link communicates
information about the relationship between two documents, readers of
either document might want to know about the relationship, so links
should work in both directions.  On the other hand, if two documents
are being managed by two different authorities (e.g., <a
href="http://nytimes.com">The New York Times</a> and <a
href="http://spinsanity.org/">Spinsanity</a>), a protocol that requires
two-way links would require both authorities to cooperate with each
other to maintain the links.
<p>
<a href="http://infomesh.net/2001/enquire/manual/">ENQUIRE</a>, an
earlier hypertext system that Berners-Lee wrote, used <a
href="http://infomesh.net/2001/enquire/manual/p7.gif">two-way
links</a>, but this was a system where all the linked information was
on one server.  For the Web, Berners-Lee adopted <a
href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/BuildingBackLinks.html">a
technique</a> proposed by Phillip Hallam-Baker: use one-way links, but
allow the server to find out where a page is being linked from.  The
server of the page being linked to can use this information, or ignore it.
<h3>Using the Referrer</h3>
Any system for CGI scripting has a way to access the referrer (or, as
the HTTP standard calls it, the "referer").  In
Perl, for example, using the CGI module, you can do it like this...
<blockquote><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use CGI qw/:standard/;
print header("text/plain"),
  "To get here, you clicked on a link from ", referer();
</pre></blockquote>
...to generate a page like
<a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/tb/example1.pl">this one</a>.
This is how, for example, many <a
href="http://www.decafbad.com/afasadst">custom 404 pages</a> point
back to the page with the dead link.
<p>
If you don't mind information from complete strangers filling up your
hard drive, you can write a slightly more complicated script, and make
a permanent record of pages linked to your own:
<blockquote><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -T
use CGI qw/:standard/;

# ignore URLs with invalid characters
if (referer() =~ m|^([-\w?.+\%/:&]+)$|) {
  $r = $1 . "\n";
} else {
  $r = '';
}

open REFERIN, "./referers" or die "Can't open the referers file for input: $!";
@referers = &lt;REFERIN&gt;;
close REFERIN;
if ($r) {
  $foundit = grep { $_ eq $r } @referers;
  unless ($foundit) {
    open REFEROUT, ">>./referers" or
      die "Can't open the referers file for output: $!";
    print REFEROUT $r;
    close REFEROUT;
    push @referers, $r;
  }
}

print header, start_html("Example 2"),
  p("Links to this page have been followed from the following URLs:"),
  ul(li(\@referers));
</pre></blockquote>
Now, if you create a Web
page with a link to <a
href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/tb/example2.pl">this page</a>, and
click on the link, you can see your page's URL in the list.

<h3>Using the Referer, Practically</h3>

That script is fine as a proof of concept, but it's not very useful.
If our page accumulates inbound links over a long period of time, the
only way to trim the list would be to manually edit the "referers"
file.  If a link to our page appears in a Slashdot comment, which can
be viewed through a variety of URLs (as a standalone comment, as part
of a threaded comments page, as part of a nested comments page, as
part of a nested comments page with threshold 2, etc.), then every one
of those URLs could appear in our list.  Most importantly, since this
is a CGI script, the only way we could append a list of inbound links
to a regular HTML page is by turning that page into a CGI script.
<p>
To work around these problems, a number of programmers have provided
<a href="http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/linkback.html">self-contained
scripts</a> that can keep track of inbound links and display them on your
page, with a minimum of effort on your part.  For example,
<a href="http://www.downes.ca/">Stephen Downes</a> has a <a
href="http://www.downes.ca/referrers.htm">system</a> that is based on
Javascript: you add a little Javascript to your page, and when someone
reads it, if his or her browser supports Javascript, it calls up a CGI
script on <em>his</em> site, and where the HTML source had Javascript,
the browser shows a list of links.  So, even though the server for
this page does not support CGI scripts, if your browser has Javascript
enabled, you can see a list of links to this page right here:
<blockquote>
<script language="Javascript" src="http://www.downes.ca/referrers.js"></script>
</blockquote>
<p>
Log files provide another source of referral information.  If your Web
server uses the <a
href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/logs.html#combined">Combined Log
Format</a>, its log file should have lines like
<blockquote><tt>
192.168.1.1 - - [01/Apr/2003:14:58:54 -0500] "GET /tb/example2.pl
HTTP/1.1" 200 390 <b>"http://ropine.com/essays/trackback.html"</b>
"Mozilla/5.0 Galeon/1.2.5 (X11; Linux i686; U;) Gecko/20020623 Debian/1.2.5-0.woody.1"
</tt></blockquote>
The field marked in <b>boldface</b> is the referrer.
<p>
<a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim</a> has written <a
href="http://diveintomark.org/projects/pysitestats/index.html">PySiteStats</a>,
a Python system that generates reports from access logs.  Among other
things, this system can produce a <a
href="http://diveintomark.org/about/stats/referers.html">list of referrers</a>.

<h3>From the Referer to Trackback</h3>

The folks at Movable Type have created a lot of buzz in the weblog
community with their <a
href="http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mttrackback.html">Trackback</a>
standard.  In a weblog that uses Trackback, every weblog entry or
category has a "Trackback URL".  This URL doesn't point to a normal
Web page, or even to a CGI script that outputs HTML.  Instead, the
authors of other weblogs can use tools on their end (such as, ahem, <a
href="http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/beginners/">Movable
Type</a>'s blog-entry editor) to "ping" this URL with information
about the relationship between two blog entries.
<p>
Why would anyone
go through all this trouble to announce that they've commented on
someone else's weblog, when they have HTTP referrers for free?  The
Trackback protocol has a number of features that ordinary referrers
don't have.
<ul>
<li>If the weblogs at both ends have Trackback configured properly,
commenting on another weblog using the Trackback protocol is as easy
as replying to an email message.
<li>With most weblog systems, each entry in a weblog
can be read through at least three URLs: one for the weblog's main
page, one for the entry's "permalink", and one for the weekly or
monthly archive that contains the entry.  A referrer-based system
cannot reliably tell that three URLs containing links to a certain
page are actually three views of the same content.  A Trackback ping
will send the permalink for the entry containing the comment, and
nothing else.
<li>The Trackback ping may also contain an excerpt from the comment
being made, the title of the entry with the comment, and the title of
the blog with the comment.  The referrer contains only a URL.
<li>Weblog categories, as well as individual entries, can contain
Trackback URLs.  For example, <a href="http://theredkitchen.net/">The
Red Kitchen</a>, a cooks' weblog, has a Trackback-based system for <a
href="http://theredkitchen.net/guest.html">guest recipe
submissions,</a> as well as Trackback URLs attached to <a
href="http://love-productions.com/mt/mt-tb.cgi?__mode=view&entry_id=7507">individual
recipes</a>.
<li>A referrer can announce a link between two Web pages, but not the
intention of the person making a link.  A Trackback ping sends a
clear signal: "I made a comment on what you wrote, and I want you to
see it."  It's the difference between observing who can hear what you
say, and knowing who has joined your conversation.
</ul>

<h3>On Beyond Trackback</h3>
Back at the dawn of the Web, when Berners-Lee wondered whether or not
to allow two-way links, he also wondered: <a
href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Topology.html#4">Should there be
different types of links?</a>  Again, when he designed HTTP, he chose
not to imitate the design of his earlier system.
<p>
The two-way links of
ENQUIRE could describe six kinds of relationships:
<ol>
<li>uses / used-by
<li>includes / part-of
<li>made / made-by
<li>describes / described-by
<li>background / detail
<li>similar-to / other
</ol>
But in HTTP, a link is a link is a link, and any information about
<em>what kind of</em> link has been made has to be carried "out of band".
<p>
The Trackback protocol provides one way to carry this
information&#8212;to announce that one page <em>comments on</em> or
<em>is commented on by</em> another.  More importantly, the weblogging
tools that implement Trackback make it easy for users to exploit the protocol.
<p>
What's next?  What other protocols and authoring tools can enrich our
experience of reading, writing, and linking on the Web?  Which of
these tools will actually become popular with the users, and which
will remain stuck in the land of "if only everyone did this"?  Stay
tuned, true believers....
