<i>Scene: A smoke-filled room, somewhere in Washington, DC.</i>

ggg I suppose you're wondering why I brought you here.  I would like
to propose a change in the law which -- if you both help me achieve it
-- will be in your mutual interest.

bbb What interest could <em>I</em> have in common with a
Bible-thumping Neanderthal?

www What interest could <em>I</em> have in common with a Godless
technocrat?

ggg You have a common enemy: Hollywood.  To you, Mr. Black,
Hollywood threatens your livelihood: It litigates
promising new technologies such as Napster out of existence, and
expands its control over its customers through such laws as the
Digital Millenium Copyright Act.  To you, Mr. White, Hollywood
threatens your values: Its products undermine traditional values, and
its marketing campaigns appeal to customers' basest desires.
<p>
But Hollywood's money, and hence is political clout, depend on one
thing: <em>copyright</em>.  Without the legal right to impose
licensing conditions on anyone who copies its works, your common enemy
would be toothless.

bbb Well, I'm not happy with a lot of the recent changes in copyright
law, but I still believe in the <em>moral</em> principle behind
copyright.  If I devote my efforts to creating a book, or movie, or
computer program, I deserve to be compensated for that effort.  The
people who say "information wants to be free" can do what they want
with their own work, but they shouldn't make that choice for me.

www And I don't see how eliminating copyright law will solve the
problems that concern me.  The French repealed their copyright laws
soon after their revolution, and after they did so, the <em>only</em>
publishers who could make money were the ones printing smut; that was
the only kind of literature that had a sure enough return to be worth
the investment.  Eliminating copyright might eliminate Hollywood's
marketing machine, but it would make all sorts of trash available for
free.  That wouldn't look like an improvement.

ggg I don't want to <em>eliminate</em> copyright laws; I want to
<em>reform</em> them.  I would like you to work with me to draft an
amendment to the copyright laws, which we can propose to our friends
in Congress, and which contains the following provisions:
<ul>
<li>A tax shall be imposed on all digital-recording media,
such as hard drives, recordable CDs, and flash memory, sold in the
United States.  (The procedure for determining the tax rate is
discussed below.)
<li>Revenues from this tax will not go into the general budget, but
into a special trust fund.
<li>Every year, the fund's administrators will survey a random sample
of Americans, to find out (a) what digital-recording media they have
access to, both at home and at work; (b) what work stored on that media
has a registered copyright, where the copyright owner is <em>not</em>
the person being surveyed; (c) how much storage space each of these
copyrighted works is taking up.
<li>Based on this survey, the trust fund will draw up an estimate of
how many digital copies of each copyrighted work exist in the United
States, and allocate the incoming tax money to the copyright holders,
where each copyright holder's share is proportional to the number of
estimated copies times the number of bits each copy takes up.
<li>
