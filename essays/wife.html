<h2>A Husband Reviews <a href="http://surrenderedwife.com/">The
Surrendered Wife</h2>

When I was engaged, a friend of ours offered me these words of advice:
"The secret to a successful marriage: 'Yesdear'.  One word.  Seven
letters.  'Yesdear'."  This counsel has served me well for the past
two and a half years of our marriage.  Yet according to Laura Doyle,
author of this year's favorite retro women's self-help book, our
marriage is deficient, because <em>she</em>, not I, should be the only
one saying "Yesdear" in this relationship.
