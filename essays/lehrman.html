<h2>Response to "Homosexuality: A Political Mask for Promiscuity"</h2>

<div class="comment">
The Spring 2000 issue of <cite>Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish
Thought</cite> had an article by Dr. Nathaniel S. Lehrman titled
"Homosexuality: A Political Mask for Promiscuity: A Psychiatrist
Reviews the Data".  My reply appeared in the Winter 2000 issue.

<p class="mtb">
To the editor:
<p>
Dr. Nathaniel S. Lehrman decries the "common misconception that
homosexuality is irreversible" once that behavior has begun.  "There
is, in fact, little to substantiate such a notion."  To substantiate
his own claim to the contrary, he provides a few anecdotes, and quotes
a few gay writers who are not psychiatrists.  He refers to "[m]any
reports ... in the psychiatric literature", but his 47 footnotes do
not specify one such report.  Psychiatric efforts to turn homosexuals
into heterosexuals -- what some people now call "reparative therapy"
-- have a decades-long track record, and on balance, the record
supports the "common misconception", not Dr. Lehrman.
<p>
Dr. D. Haldeman, in the April 1994 issue of the <cite>Journal of
Consulting and Clinical Psychology</cite>, reviews various studies of
attempts to change sexual orientation, and discusses both their
results and their methodology.  Consider two examples, one from 1962 and one
from 1980.
<p>
Dr. Irving Bieber and his colleagues surveyed psychoanalysts with
homosexual patients.  According to the analysts, out of 76 men who
were exclusively homosexual before treatment, only 14 (less than 20
percent) were exclusively heterosexual after treatment.  Dr. Haldeman
points out that many studies like Bieber's conflate the figures for
homosexual and bisexual clients, and thus overestimate the success
rate of treatment.  Dr. Lehrman blames "ubiquitous gay support groups"
for a decline in therapy's success rate, but he cannot blame them for
Bieber's statistics: in 1962, when Dr. Bieber's research was
published, gay-rights organizations had virtually no influence.  The
conservatism of the Mattachine Society of New York (MSNY), one of the
earliest "homophile" organizations, is a case in point.  At the start
of the 1960s, MSNY leaders avoided claiming that homosexuals were as
mentally healthy as heterosexuals, and they looked down on those who
were promiscuous or flamboyant.  At the end of the decade, the MSNY
had fewer than a dozen members willing to reveal their sexuality in
public.  (See Toby Marotta's history, <cite>The Politics of
Homosexuality</cite>, for more information about the MSNY.)
<p>
Dr. E. Mansell Patterson and Myrna Loy Patterson evaluated men
affiliated with Exodus International, a coalition of Christian
"ex-gay" ministries.  They reported on their research in the December
1980 issue of the <cite>American Journal of Psychiatry</cite>.  Out of
300 clients in the organization's files, the Pattisons found thirty
people who claimed to have changed from homosexuality to
heterosexuality, and got permission to interview eleven men; they
concluded that "eight of our eleven subjects [less than five percent
of the original 300] amply demonstrated a 'cure'.  The remaining three
subjects had a major behavioral and intrapsychic shift to
heterosexual behavior, but the persistence of homosexual impulses was
still significant."  Again, to blame these figures on gay-support
groups strains credulity.  At Exodus, according to former directors of
the organization (interviewed in the documentary <cite>One Nation
Under God</cite>), counselors advised clients to avoid media with
pro-gay messages.  Clients were actively religious, according to the
Pattisons, and saw becoming "straight" as their religious
responsibility.  If gay-support groups were powerful enough to
influence people in those circumstances, we should wonder why anybody
in America today is <em>hetero</em>sexual.
<p>
Dr. Lehrman regrets that there are no Jewish-affiliated, Exodus-like
groups for homosexuals who want to change.  Considering the
embarassments that the Christian groups have suffered, perhaps that is
just as well.  Two of the Pattisons' eight "cured" subjects, Michael
Bussee and Gary Cooper, were among the founders of Exodus and helped
the Pattisons with their research.  In 1979, they dropped out of the
organization and announced that they were gay after all.  Later,
according to Haldeman, they described the Exodus program as
"ineffective ... not one person was healed".  Their defection is not
unusual: according to <cite>Newsweek</cite> ("Can gays convert?",
August 17, 1998), thirteen ministries affiliated with Exodus have had
to close because the ministries' directors became "ex-ex-gay".
Dr. Haldeman also cites cases of Christian counselors who called
themselves "ex-gay" and were later caught having sexual relations with
male clients.
<p class="comment">
The most noteworthy such case is Colin Cook.  In 1974, he was a
Seventh-Day Adventist minister, and was kicked out of the ministry for
having sex with one of his congregants.  He went on to found Quest,
later called Homosexuals Anonymous, but in 1986, he admitted having
sexual encounters with several of his counselees.  In 1995, two men
counseled by Cook told <cite>The Denver Post</cite> that
Cook had been having erotic telephone conversations with them in the
guise of providing counseling.  One of these men provided tape
recordings to the <cite>Post</cite>.
<p class="comment">
After this letter was sent to <cite>Tradition</cite>, John Paulk --
one of the "ex-gays" that Lehrman cited with approval in his paper --
was photographed by gay-rights activists in a D.C. gay bar.  The
Exodus North America board of directors responded to the scandal by
removing Paulk as chairman of the board.  For more details, see <a
href="http://www.exodusnorthamerica.org/news/pressrel/a0000538.html">this
press release from Exodus</a>.
<p>
After reviewing a dozen studies from Dr. Bieber onward, Dr. Haldeman
concludes: "No consistency emerges from the extant database, which
suggest that sexual orientation is amenable to redirection or
significant influence from psychological intervention."  Regarding
"ex-gay" ministries, he says, "although many of these practitioners
publicly promise change, they privately acknowledge that celibacy is
the realistic goal to which lesbians and gay men must aspire."
<p>
Note Dr. Haldeman's qualifying phrase, "from psychological
intervention".  Certainly, some people may change their sexual
behavior: a woman who thinks of herself as a lesbian may fall in love
with a man, or a bisexual man may choose male partners at one point in
his life and female partners at another.  Dr. Lehrman, however, makes
a more sweeping claim: that <em>all</em> homosexual people could
become heterosexual, given the desire to change and "competent
counseling".  Dr. Haldeman could argue that Mr. Bussee, Mr. Cooper,
and every other person who dropped out of a reparative-therapy program
didn't really want to change, or didn't have the right counselors, but
this "heads I win, tails you lose" argument is the antithesis of
science.
<p>
When Dr. Lehrman's argument moves from science to <i>hashkafa</i>
<span class="comment">[Jewish philosophy]</span>, he is on slightly
firmer ground.  He quotes Maimonides as saying, "we all choose each
day between good and evil, and by our choices we can become as holy as
Moses or as evil as Jeroboam".  (This quotation has no footnote: I
found similar but not identical language in <i>Hilkhot Teshuva</i>
5:2.)  However, Maimonides also says (<i>Shmoneh Perakim</i> 8, first
paragraph) that "it is possible for a person to be born with a nature
that is disposed to a virtue or a vice, so that one sort of deed is
easier than another."  Our faith assures us that abstaining from
<i>averot</i> <span class="comment">[violations of Jewish religious
law]</span> is possible, but the shortage of Jews who are as righteous
as Moses proves how difficult the job is.  Some gay men may
underestimate their capacity for self-control, but Dr. Lehrman
trivializes their feelings with terms like "a political mask for
promiscuity" and "homosexual choice and habit".
<p>
If Dr. Lehrman's claim about sexual orientation were true, life would
be more comfortable for many people in the Orthodox community --
especially for Orthodox homosexuals, their families, and the rabbis
who counsel them.  However, in science (as, <i>lehavdil</i>, in
<i>halakha</i> <span class="comment">[Jewish religious law]</span>),
the more comfortable theory is not always the more credible one.

Along with my letter, two other comments on Lehrman's article were
printed in the Winter 2000 issue of <cite>Tradition</cite>.  Lehrman's
response to those letters reads, in part:
<blockquote>
The respondents' doubts about homosexuality's reversibility are based
entirely on professional literature reports of psychotherapists' lack
of success.  Those failures are due more to a passive approach than to
homosexuality's alleged irreversibility.  People's ability, without
therapy, to change sexual partners, and to change to partners of
different genders, has been recognized for millennia.  We cannot
dismiss this as merely anecdotal -- as though the psychiatric
literature encompasses all humanity has ever known on the subject.
The greatly reduced number of reports on homosexuality treatment in
that literature since the American Psychiatric Association removed
homosexuality from its list of psychiatric disorders in 1973 was noted
in my paper.  It also pointed out the homosexual conspiracies to
persuade the professions and society as a whole that therapeutic
efforts to help people wanting to give up homosexuality are <em>per
se</em> unethical!
<p>
I made no sweeping claim that all homosexual people, given competent
counseling and the desire to change, can become heterosexual.  Bad
habits are hard to correct, and social supports for them -- drug
subcultures, homosexual support groups and media endorsement -- makes
breaking them even harder.  Considerable effort is required to give up
drugs, smoking or homosexuality.  While competent counseling can help,
incompetent psychotherapy can impede.
