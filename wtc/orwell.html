<h2>Goldstein, bin Laden, and Orwell</h2>

When I was a yeshiva student in Israel, a classmate told me of a tour
he had taken in Hebron.  As the tour bus passed a certain monument,
the guide had said: "This is the grave of Dr. Goldstein, who was
killed by the Arabs.  --Not that I'm defending what he did...."
<p>
This is the postmodern response to a politically inconvenient
atrocity.  When someone affiliated with your favorite cause does
something indefensible (e.g., when Baruch Goldstein, a Jewish resident
of the West Bank, kills 29 Arabs in cold blood in a mosque during
Ramadan), it can be hard to deny that the atrocity happened at all, or
argue that it is actually a good thing, or insist that someone else
had their finger on the trigger.  But you can always utter the
appropriate platitudes of shame, in as few words as possible, and
direct the audience's attention to the <em>convenient</em> atrocities,
i.e., those committed by your enemies.
<p>
This rhetorical trick is alive and well, and not just in Hebron.  The
World Trade Center collapsed less than a week ago, and the estimated death toll is
six thousand civilians and counting, but the non-apology for its attack has
become a genre unto itself.  Consider:
<ul>
<li><a
href="http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20011001&s=fisk">Robert
Fisk</a>, in the October 1 issue of <cite>The Nation</cite>: "...those
who claim to represent a crushed, humiliated population struck back
with the wickedness and awesome cruelty of a doomed people.... Our
broken promises, perhaps even our destruction of the Ottoman Empire,
led inevitably to this tragedy."

<li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,551036,00.html">
Seumas Milne</a>, in <cite>The Guardian</cite>: "As Mahatma Gandhi
famously remarked when asked his opinion of western civilisation, it
would be a good idea."

<li><a
href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2001/09/17/israel/index.html">Gary
Kamiya</a>, in <cite>Salon</cite>: "But as we look down the long,
dangerous road that lies ahead, we must remember that there is one
specific grievance that rankles in the breasts of millions of Arab and
Islamic people in the world."

<li><a href="http://www.zmag.org/chomnote.htm">Noam Chomsky</a>:
"The terrorist attacks were major atrocities. In scale they may not
reach the level of many others, for example, Clinton's bombing of the
Sudan..."

<li><a href="http://www.zmag.org/calamitous_perspective.htm">Michael Alpert</a>:
"First world populations may henceforth
share not the degrading conditions and daily poverty of the third
world, but some of the fear of being held hostage by others."

<li><a href="http://www.zmag.org/pilgercalam.htm">John Pilger</a>:
"The attacks on Tuesday come at the end of a long history of betrayal
of the Islamic and Arab peoples.... There are deeper roots to the
atrocities in the US, which made them almost inevitable."

<li><a href="http://www.zmag.org/zinncalam.htm">Howard Zinn</a>:
"We need to think about the resentment all over the world felt by
people who have been the victims of American military action."

<li><a href="http://www.zmag.org/jencalam.htm">Robert Jensen</a>:
"Yes, we need to do something -- but something to shift our
policy in the Middle East from rule-by-force to the quest for
justice."

<li><a href="http://www.zmag.org/benniscalam.htm">Phyllis Bennis</a>:
"To me it's a question of the arrogance of the U.S., the policies
around the world, not only in the Middle East,... but our policies of
abandoning international law, dissing the United Nations, refusing to
sign conventions and international treaties ... not to mention the
most recent stuff about abandoning the Kyoto treaty,..."

<li><a href="http://www.zmag.org/morriscalam.htm">Doug Morris</a>: "We
thought we were free to impose military and economic violence anywhere
we chose, with impunity. The freedom from impunity appears to no
longer exist."

<li><a href="http://www.zmag.org/bricmontcalam.htm">Jean Bricmont</a>:
"By pure coincidence, the September 11
attacks took place on the anniversary of the overthrow of Allende..."

</ul>
The essays are usually couched as pleas for "understanding".  But I do
not recall such an outcry from progressives to "understand" Baruch
Goldstein as someone whose behavior, while inexcusable, was linked to
antisemitism among Arabs in Hebron.  (When you read that sentence, did
you wince, thinking that I might sympathize with Goldstein?  But can
you prove that I hold any such sentiments?  See how
effective the postmodern style is?)
In any case, since one soldier's
reprisal is another soldier's provocation, you can frame your
"understanding" to favor whichever side you like.  Fisk roots the
World Trade Center bombing in the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, but
why not go back to the Roman occupation of Judea, or to the
Israelites' wars against the Canaanites, or to some riot among the
Cro-Magnons?
<p>
What we really need to understand is why the
essays in this genre are all rubbish.  They can be summarized in words of one
syllable, as follows:
<ol>
<li>They did a bad, bad thing.
<li>If we had done as they wished, they would not have hurt us.
<li>In the past, we, as well, did bad, bad things, which hurt them,
and we still do.  We should stop.
</ol>
(The precise definitions of "we" and "they" are fuzzy, but unpacking
that aspect of the genre might require another essay of this length.
Furthermore, If
it turns out that someone outside the Islamic world was responsible
for this attack, as with the Oklahoma City bombing, that news would
undermine the essays I am commenting on, but not my analysis of their
style.)
<p>
The first of these statements makes up a small proportion of the text
of the essay.  Sometimes, it doesn't even appear in the first
paragraph; journalists call this "burying the lede".  (Pilger buries
the lede at a crossroads with a stake through its heart.)  The second
statement begs the question: is it more important to save American
lives or comply with the terrorists' desires?  (As much as I dislike
Bush's foreign policy, not to mention the process that put his
handlers in charge of it, I'm not ready to give his job
to Osama bin Laden.)  The third statement, of course,
provides the answer.  But when juxtaposed with the first, it raises a
new question, one which none of the authors linked to above seem to
recognize.
<p>
When the above essays complain about the sins of the West, the chief
complaint involves Israel, although some go farther afield.  (Do
people who join bin Laden's organization really care about the Kyoto
treaty?)  You can argue for
Palestinian statehood, or against Israel's treatment of Palestinians,
on its own merits: those causes are just as valid today as they were
on September 10.  Likewise, you can denounce terrorism and war crimes
without referring to any specific organizations or states.  But if you
acknowledge that all terrorism is bad, <em>and</em> link US/Israeli
mistreatment of Palestinians to the WTC's destruction, <em>and</em>
declare that Palestinians have a just cause, you beg the question:
<em>How, if not through terrorism, are the Palestinians going to seek
justice?</em>
<p>
The best Israeli offers to come out of the Oslo process fall short of
what Palestinians consider fair.  The US is not pressuring Israel to
offer terms more favorable to the Palestinians.  If the PA had a
conventional war with Israel, and both sides followed the Geneva
Conventions to the letter, Israel would almost certainly win.
Therefore, if the Palestinians abandon terrorism, what are they
supposed to do?
<p>
Those people who cheered the WTC's fall, Palestinian or not,
did not merely perceive that their enemy had been struck.  They
perceived that their enemy had been struck <em>in a way that gave them
hope of victory</em>.  The non-apologists are quick to advise
the West on the moral and practical route to prevent terrorism, but
say nothing to would-be terrorists about the moral and practical route
to achieve their own goals.  Fisk calls the carnage inevitable, as if
the people who conspired to attack New York had no free will, and
therefore no moral responsibility for their decisions.
Kamiya proposes terms for the US to dictate to both Israel and the PA,
but does not say how to respond if Arafat rejects them.
The rest, for all I know, want to reconcile their
hatred of terrorism with their love for the causes that motivate
certain terrorists.  However, when I see those two
sentiments appear in the same document, with no statement about <em>how</em> to
reconcile them, and measure how many words are
spent on each one ... I imagine a cigarette advertisement, a two-page
spread depicting happy smokers, with the health warning confined to
a square-inch box in the corner.
<p>
We all know that those who proclaim "the end justifies the means" are
allies of terror.  But so, too, are those who mumble "the end is
justified" and don't want to think about the means.  These are the
people who donate to charities with bland names, but do not ask how
the money is spent; who cheer the leaders calling for
retribution, but dismiss the most bloodthirsty calls as hyperbole;
who see evidence of crimes being plotted, but do not risk the stigma
of becoming informers.  For such people, the words of Fisk, Chomsky,
and Zinn provide a balm.
<p>
Orwell, in <a
href="http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/nationalism.html">"Notes on
Nationalism"</a>, wrote: "It is difficult if not impossible for any
nationalist to conceal his allegiance.  The smallest slur upon his own
unit, or any implied praise of a rival organization, fills him with
uneasiness which he can only relieve by making some sharp retort."
The recent slaughter has inspired many such retorts.  Their authors,
in the way that they ask us to "understand," prove that they do not
understand the depth of their own prejudices.
