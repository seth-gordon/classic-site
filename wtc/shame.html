<h1>Shame!</h1>

<h2>Why no American should harrass or attack
the Arabs and Muslims living here</h2>

<blockquote>
<i>"Thou shalt not stand idly by the blood of thy neighbor"
--Leviticus 19:16</i>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>It's immoral.

<li>If you have evidence that someone might be a criminal, tell
the FBI.  If you don't, just what are you trying to accomplish?

<li>Have you considered joining the Army?  What, you don't want to
fight enemies who can shoot back at you?

<li>It's immoral.

<li>People move to this country to <em>escape</em> governments like
the Taliban.

<li>The perpetrators of the first World Trade Center bombing were
caught because one person in their organization informed on them.
Other attacks by Osama bin Laden's organization have been prevented
because members have become informants.  If every Muslim in America
feels like a target of random violence, how many more will want to
cooperate with the authorities?

<li>It's immoral.

<li>Can you even tell the difference between a Muslim and a Sikh, or
between an Arab and a Pakistani?

<li>Racism is <em>still</em> un-American, dammit.

<li>Did we mention that it's immoral?
