      <p class="lead text-center">(but hopefully we’ve answered all the questions that might come up)</p>

    <h2>Lodging</h2>
      <p>
	We have arranged for discounted hotel rooms at the Holiday Inn
	Boston-Brookline, at 1200 Beacon Street, Brookline. <em>This is
	  a courtesy rate, not a reserved block, so the rate only
	  applies if rooms are available.</em> Call 855-813-9839 and say
	you are looking for booking code “GBM”, or click <a href="https://www.holidayinn.com/redirect?path=hd&brandCode=hi&localeCode=en&regionCode=1&hotelCode=Bklma&_PMID=99801505&GPC=GBM&viewfullsite=true">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
	The hotel is about a 10-minute drive away from the synagogue.
	If you want to spare yourself finding a parking space, you can
	take the trolley. The hotel is right next to the St. Paul station
	on the Green Line “C”, and the synagogue is a block away from
	the Washington Street station on the Green Line “B”.  Walking
	cross-town and then taking the trolley, or vice versa, will take
	you about half an hour.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>If you are shomer shabbat</b> and would like a place to stay
	on Friday night, please let us know. We understand if the two days
	of yom tov before Shabbat (see below) makes it difficult for you to
	attend; this circumstance also makes it difficult for us to find
	housing for three consecutive nights.
      </p>
      <h2>The synagogue</h2>
      <p>
	<a href="http://www.kadimahtorasmoshe.org">Congregation
	  Kadimah-Toras Moshe</a> (KTM), located at 113 Washington Street
	in Brighton (near the corner of Washington Street and
	Commonwealth Avenue) is a small Orthodox synagogue.
      </p>
      <h3>Some points of etiquette</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Men and women are seated separately for prayer, with a room
	divider (mechitza).  With a few exceptions, only Jewish males
	  age 13 and up take part in running services.  Unless you are the
	  first to arrive, it should be immediately obvious which side is
	  which.  Siddurim (prayer books) and chumashim (Bibles) are
	  available on the shelves immediately inside the sanctuary doors.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Men (even non-Jewish men) should have their heads covered with
	  a kippah (yarmulke, skullcap) or a hat approriate for a place
	  of worship.  Kippot will be available in a basket in the
	  lobby.  Jewish men may wear taleisim (prayer shawls) or not,
	  according to their tradition, but you must wear one if you are
	  participating in the liturgy or given a synagogue honor.
	</li>
	<li>
	  It is the norm in our synagogue for married women to wear a
	  hat or other hair covering, but not to wear a kippah or a
	  tallis.  However, you should do what works for you.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Dress is business-casual or better, and modest appropriate
	  for the wearer’s age and respect for a place of worship.
	  For men, jackets and/or ties are common but not universal.
	  Most adult women wear the sort of skirts and blouses you
	  would wear to be a secretary in an office with periodic
	  client contact, and flat shoes; some wear more formal
	  businesswear, and some wear pantsuits. Kids wear whatever
	  their parents can convince them to wear. Sometimes the best
	  they can manage is pajamas.
	</li>
	<li>
	  In order to enhance our members’ concentration on the
	  holiness of the Sabbath day, please silence your cell phone
	  and do not use it, or cameras, or similar equipment, on the
	  synagogue grounds, even before and after service
	  times. Smoking is not allowed in or near the synagogue
	  building.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Children can participate in service downstairs, or they can
	  play or hang out upstairs.  There are no babysitters;
	  children should be supervised to a level appropriate to
	  their age.  <b>Warning: There is a building under construction in the lot behind
	    the synagogue.</b>
	</li>
<li>In our synagogue everyone stands for every kaddish (even the Mourner's Kaddish. We mention this because the practice of some synagogues is to have only the mourners reciting kaddish to stand.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Getting there</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Driving</dt>

      <dt>Walking</dt>
      <dd>Ask your hosts, or walk along with them.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Parking</h3>
    <p>
      While KTM has a small parking lot, it is typically closed and blocked off on the Sabbath; children often play ball in the lot.  If you are shomer Shabbat, and your host does not have a driveway or easily accessible non-resident parking, let us know and we will arrange for you to park in the KTM lot before Shabbat begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, Brighton has a variety of street parking locations
      around the synagogue.  <a href="../g-bar-mitzvah/parking-near-ktm.jpg">Here is an <em>approximate</em> map of the area’s parking.</a> Please read the signage carefully; most streets
      have a combination of visitor parking and resident-sticker-only
      parking.
    </p>
    <h2>Schedule</h2>
    <h3>Wednesday night, Thursday, Friday daytime</h3>
      <p>
	The Jewish holiday of Shemini Atzeret begins on Wednesday night,
	and Simchat Torah begins on Thursday night. Consequently, we will
	be out of phone or electronic contact starting late Wednesday
	afternoon. You are welcome to join our synagogue for Shemini
	Atzeret or Simchat Torah services, but these are not part of the
	bar mitzvah.
      </p>
      <h3>Friday evening</h3>
      <p>
	For out-of-town guests, and for shomer shabbat guests who will
	be staying nearby, we will host a reception on Friday night,
	followed by Shabbat dinner, <em>at our house</em>.
	Candle-lighting for Shabbat is at 5:48 p.m.; the reception
	will begin at 6:30.  When you respond to our invitation,
	please let us know if you will be attending the reception.
      </p>
      <p>
	This reception, and dessert following havdallah on Saturday night,
	will be in lieu of the customary bar mitzvah
	party. A paintball party for Sam’s classmates is in the works.
      </p>
      <h3>Saturday morning services</h3>
      <p>
	Shacharit begins at 8:45 a.m.; if you want to make sure that you
	will hear Sam leyn his Torah portion (the first aliyah of Bereshit,
	the one with the seven days of creation), you should show up by
	9:00. Services will run until shortly after noon.
      </p>
      <h3>Lunch following services</h3>
      <p>
	We'll ask guests to move out of the way or to help as we move
	chairs to the side and set up some tables for a light kiddush
	luncheon with the KTM community. Once you've re-entered the
	room, please wait until someone has made kiddush (the blessing
	over grape juice). If it's too loud, or you don't know how on
	earth you'd recognize kiddush even if it was said in your ear,
	then as a practical matter, take a general “amen!” as a cue to
	get yourself some lunch. If it is your tradition to wash
	ritually before eating bread, the sinks are in the rear corner
	of the women's section.
      </p>
      <p>
	After people have had a chance to get a little food, Sam will
	speak about his Torah portion, and one or more parents will
	speak. Lunch will conclude with bentsching (grace after meals)
	at some point. Timing is vague because people will hang
	out as long as they like, and leave as they need to leave.
      </p>
      <h3>The rest of the afternoon</h3>
      <p>
	Many guests will now disperse to home or hotel. Those who are
	shomer shabbas or who otherwise want to hang out. If the
	weather permits, we may also head for a local park/playground.
      </p>
      <p>
	The rabbi holds a class late Saturday afternoon in the
	synagogue, followed by mincha services, seudah shlishit, and
	maariv. Havdallah (the end of Shabbat) will be at about 6:48
	p.m., after which guests are invited to join us at our house
	for dessert.
