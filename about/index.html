<h2>Our Happy Little Network</h2>

Our domain name, <tt>ropine.com</tt>, is derived from atropine, the heart
stimulant that makes "deadly nightshade" so deadly.  (Atropine
... <tt>@ropine</tt> ... get it?  Well, it seemed clever at the time.)  All of
the machines on our network, therefore, are named after plants in the
nightshade (Solanaceae) family.

<h3><tt>tomato</tt></h3>

Thanks to the generosity of <a
href="http://www.mit.edu/~amgreene/">Andrew Greene</a>, <a
href="http://www.greenehouse.com/h/">Heather Greene</a>, <a
href="http://world.std.com/~gnomi/">Nomi Burstein</a>, <a
href="http://www.mabfan.com/">Michael Burstein</a>, <a
href="http://www.mit.edu/~jik/">Jon Kamens</a>, and Andrea Kamens, we
are the proud owners of a <a
href="http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid=142&grid=5">Linksys
BEFSR11 router and firewall</a>.  (They're geeks.  We're geeks.  They
wanted to give us a house-warming present.  What could be more
appropriate?)  Having this device between (most of) our computers and the DSL
line will spare me a valuable learning experience.

<h3><tt>horse-nettle</tt></h3>

This is an ancient 486 machine that I salvaged from <a
href="http://www.uniquesimchas.invitations.com">Unique Simchas</a>.
Before I got <tt>tomato</tt>, I was planning to use this machine as a
firewall.  It serves static Web pages with <a
href="http://cr.yp.to/publicfile.html"><tt>publicfile</tt></a> and
lets us log in through <a
href="http://www.openssh.com/"><tt>ssh</tt></a>.  It uses <a
href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/"><tt>xntpd</tt></a> to keep track of the
time, thanks to the stratum-2 NTP servers at the University of
Massachusetts at Boston, the University of Delaware, and Columbia
University.
<p>
Using <a href="http://cr.yp.to/qmail.html"><tt>qmail</tt></a>, it
accepts email to and from <tt>ropine.com</tt>, and runs a
<a href="http://www.inter7.com/courierimap.html">Courier IMAP</a>
server, so I can read my mail remotely.
<p>
This machine also runs <a
href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dnscache.html"><tt>dnscache</tt></a>, so
it can be a caching proxy server, and <a
href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/tinydns.html"><tt>tinydns</tt></a>, so it can be
the primary nameserver for <tt>ropine.com</tt>.
<p>
In order to provide DNS service to the rest of the Net,
<tt>horse-nettle</tt> can't run within the firewall (<tt>tomato</tt>'s
implementation of NAT doesn't Do The Right Thing with inbound DNS
queries).  To reduce its exposure to 31337 h@x0rs, <tt>horse-nettle</tt>
runs <a href="http://openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>, the OS of choice
for paranoid geeks on low budgets.

<h3><tt>petunia</tt></h3>

This is my workstation, a 350 MHz Pentium II, which we bought in July
1999.  The retailer, by the way, was <a
href="http://pcsforeveryone.com/">PCs for Everyone</a> -- if you're in
the Boston area and want a custom-built x86 computer, I strongly
recommend them.
<p>
One of the features that distinguishes <tt>petunia</tt>
from its neighbors is <em>the case</em>: after sliding it off, I can
reattach it without wrestling a square meter of metal.
Maybe the name-brand PC boxes are equally well-constructed, but
<tt>eggplant</tt> and <tt>horse-nettle</tt> were assembled by NPC (a
shop in Newton) and DTK Computer (I've never heard of them, either),
respectively, and they obviously cut corners on the quality of their
cases.
<p>
It runs the "unstable" distribution of
<a href="http://debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a>, as well as
<a href="http://postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> and
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a>.  For a while,
I was using it to host an <a href="http://bestpractical.com/rt/">RT</a>
server for our group's bug-tracking system.

<h3><tt>eggplant</tt></h3>

Jen got this computer, a Pentium 100, back in 1996.  After the traumatic
experience of writing an eight-hundred-page dissertation in Microsoft
Word, she defenestrated Windows 95 from it, and we installed
<a href="http://redhat.com/">Red Hat Linux 6.0</a>.
Then, trying to use <a href="http://staroffice.com/">StarOffice 5.1</a>
to keep track of the family finances, she suffered a further trauma,
but we couldn't find our Windows 95 CD, so we just decommissioned the
computer, bought a new Windows PC (so that Jen could play <em>Command
and Conquer</em>), and moved its hard drive into <tt>petunia</tt>.

<h3><tt>belladonna</tt></h3>

This is a Compaq Presario 710US laptop that Seth bought in the summer
of 2002.  It has a wireless Ethernet card that communicates with an
AirPort base station behind the firewall.  It runs the "stable"
distribution of <a href="http://debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a>.
