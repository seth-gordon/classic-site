<h2>Our Happy Little Network</h2>

Our domain name, <tt>ropine.com</tt>, is derived from atropine, the heart
stimulant that makes "deadly nightshade" so deadly.  (Atropine
... <tt>@ropine</tt> ... get it?  Well, it seemed clever at the time.)  All of
the machines on our network, therefore, are named after plants in the
nightshade (<a
href="http://www.keil.ukans.edu/delta/angio/www/solanace.htm">Solanaceae</a>)
family.
<br clear="all" />

<h3><tt>tomato</tt></h3>

Thanks to the generosity of <a
href="http://www.mit.edu/~amgreene/">Andrew Greene</a>, <a
href="http://www.greenehouse.com/h/">Heather Greene</a>, <a
href="http://world.std.com/~gnomi/">Nomi Burstein</a>, <a
href="http://www.mabfan.com/">Michael Burstein</a>, <a
href="http://www.mit.edu/~jik/">Jon Kamens</a>, and Andrea Kamens, we
are the proud owners of a <a
href="http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid=142&grid=5">Linksys
BEFSR11 router and firewall</a>.  (They're geeks.  We're geeks.  They
wanted to give us a house-warming present.  What could be more
appropriate?)  Having this device between (most of) our computers and the DSL
line will spare me a valuable learning experience.

<h3><tt>horse-nettle</tt></h3>

This is an ancient 486 machine that I salvaged from <a
href="mailto:uniqsimcha@aol.com">Unique Simchas</a>.  Before I got
<tt>tomato</tt>, I was planning to use this machine as a firewall.  It serves
static Web pages with <a
href="http://cr.yp.to/publicfile.html"><tt>publicfile</tt></a> and
lets us log in through <a href="http://www.openssh.com/"><tt>ssh</tt></a>.
<p>
Using <a href="http://cr.yp.to/qmail.html"><tt>qmail</tt></a>, it
accepts email to and from <tt>ropine.com</tt>.
With <a
href="http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/rblsmtpd.html">rblsmtpd</a>, it blocks
mail from any IP address on the <a
href="http://mail-abuse.org/rbl/">MAPS Realtime Blackhole List</a>.
(Since my unmunged email address appears in my Slashdot user profile,
my Usenet postings, etc., I'm an easy target for the address
harvesters.  Installing this filter reduced incoming spam by at least
two-thirds.)
<p>
This machine also runs <a
href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dnscache.html"><tt>dnscache</tt></a>, so
it can be a caching proxy server for my other machines, and <a
href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/tinydns.html">tinydns</a>, so it can be
the primary nameserver for <tt>ropine.com</tt>.  (Until the
appropriate switches are turned at my ISP and at Network Solutions,
however, the authoritative ropine.com DNS servers are at <a
href="http://shore.net/">ShoreNet</a>.)
<p>
In order to provide DNS service to the rest of the Net,
<tt>horse-nettle</tt> can't run within the firewall (<tt>tomato</tt>'s
implementation of NAT doesn't Do The Right Thing with inbound DNS
queries).  To reduce its exposure to 31337 h@x0rs, <tt>horse-nettle</tt>
runs <a href="http://openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>, the OS of choice
for paranoid geeks on low budgets.

<h3><tt>petunia</tt></h3>

This is my workstation, a 350 MHz Pentium II, which we bought in July
1999.  The retailer, by the way, was <a
href="http://pcsforeveryone.com/">PCs for Everyone</a> -- if you're in
the Boston area and want a custom-built x86 computer, I strongly
recommend them.
<p>
One of the features that distinguishes <tt>petunia</tt>
from its neighbors is <em>the case</em>: after sliding it off, I can
reattach it without wrestling a square meter of metal.
Maybe the name-brand PC boxes are equally well-constructed, but
<tt>eggplant</tt> and <tt>horse-nettle</tt> were assembled by NPC (a
shop in Newton) and DTK Computer (I've never heard of them, either),
respectively, and they obviously cut corners on the quality of their
cases.
<p>
It runs <a href="http://redhat.com/">Red Hat Linux 6.2</a>, as well as
<a href="http://postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>; one of my short-term
goals is to install <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a> as a
Web server for dynamic pages, and then practice mucking around with
<tt>mod_perl</tt>, Web/database integration, etc.

<h3><tt>eggplant</tt></h3>

Jen got this computer, a Pentium 100, back in 1996.  After having
defenestrated Windows 95, it now runs <a href="http://redhat.com/">Red Hat
Linux 6.0</a>.  Aside from the usual mailing and surfing, she runs <a
href="http://staroffice.com/">StarOffice 5.1</a> on this machine to
track, among other things, our household budget, which has no money
left for new hardware.  Oh, the pain, the suffering.

<h3>Specifications</h3>

<tt>dmesg</tt> printouts for <a
