				<i>Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States
				of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring
				therein),</i>
				That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution
				of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part
				of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the

						In an influential 1990 <a href="https://www.ir101.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Linz-The-Perils-of-Presidentialism.pdf">paper</a>,
						Juan J. Linz argued that parliamentary democracies are more stable
						than presidential democracies. One reason for the greater stability,
						he said, is that in a presidential system, both the president and
						the legislature can claim popular mandates, and when they are in
						conflict, there is no clear way to decide who represents the “true” voice
						of the people. In 1990, Linz had to admit that the United States,
						as a long-lasting stable presidential democracy, was an exception to
						his rule; in 2025, alas, we seem much less exceptional. This proposal
						for constitutional reform is inspired by his observation.
				</span>Elections to the House of Representatives shall be held on a date chosen by
				the President, as prescribed by law, which must be within six months of the
				dissolution of the previous House. Every citizen of the United States who
				is of eighteen years of age or older shall have the right to vote in these
				elections in their state and district of residence.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the apportionment of Representatives, the number of
				persons in a state corresponding to a single Representative
				shall not be greater than the population of the least populous
				state.
			</p>
			<p>
				Representatives shall be elected at large from each State, as follows:
				Each candidate for the House of Representatives shall be affiliated with
				a political party, with each independent candidate counted as a party of one.
				The standards regulating such affiliation shall be set by the laws of the
				United States and the several states.
				Within each State, seats in the House shall be allocated to each party in
				proportion to the votes for it, and the candidates with the most votes from
				each party shall be selected to fill those seats.<label

						This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_list">open
						list proportional representation</a>. It is used in Finland, Latvia,
						and Brazil. This technique gives racial minorities, regional interests,
						and ideological factions a route to representation without being blocked
						by gerrymandering or by party machinery.
					</span>
			</p>
			<p class="newsec">
				The House must be dissolved when Congress refuses to pass a revenue bill
				requested by the Cabinet; or when it refuses to
				pass some other bill which the Cabinet has declared to be
				essential to the operation of the Government; or when the
				House declares that it has no confidence in the Cabinet; or
				when the President, on the advice of the Cabinet, requests
				that the House be dissolved; or when five years have passed
				since the most recent term of the House began.
			</p>
			<p class="newsec">
				Except as otherwise specified in this Article or in the law, the
				House shall have the exclusive power to consent to the appointment
				of ambassadors, public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme
				Court, and all other officers of the United States. The House shall
				also have the exclusive power to ratify treaties.
			</p>
			<h3>The Senate</h3>
			<p class="newsec">
				Senators shall be chosen by the executive officers of their
				respective states,<label

					<input type="checkbox" id="sn-senate" class="margin-toggle" />
					<span class="sidenote">
						The Senate, in this model, is less democratic than the current actual
						Senate, but it is also <em>much</em> less powerful. In the best case,
						it can still function as the “cooling saucer” that George Washington
						(apocryphally) described. In the worst case, it cannot actually prevent
						the House from getting things done.
					</span> in whatever manner is determined by the
				laws of that state, for terms of twelve years. They shall remain
				divided into three classes, such that one class of Senators may
				be chosen every fourth year.
			</p>
			<p class="newsec">
				The Senate shall have the
				power to appoint auditors, Inspectors General, and Special Prosecutors.
				Such officers, once appointed, may only be dismissed for cause, according
				to the terms of their commissions. They may have such authority to prosecute
				civil and criminal cases as the law permits.
			</p>
			<p>
				If an officer of the United States exceeds their constitutional authority
				by accepting improper emoluments, or by holding office in violation of
				section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, then a Special Prosecutor appointed
				by the Senate may bring suit to deprive them of such emoluments or dismiss
				them from office.
			</p>
			<h3>Passage of Laws</h3>
			<p class="newsec">
				A bill shall be signed by the President and become law when
				it is passed by both the House and the Senate; or when it is
				passed twice by the House, with at least one year (one month,
				in the case of money bills) intervening between the two votes.<label

					<span class="sidenote">
						The British House of Lords functions in this way.
					</span>
			</p>
			<p class="newsec">
				Treaties shall be ratified in the same manner that laws are passed.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Reorganization of the Executive Branch</h2>
			<p class="newsec">
				The executive power of the United States shall be divided between a Cabinet
				and the President, both of whom shall be accountable to Congress. Officers of
				the Cabinet shall, before taking office, make the same oath or affirmation as
				the President.<label
					for="sn-president" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
					<input type="checkbox" id="sn-president" class="margin-toggle" />
					<span class="sidenote">
						In parliamentary governments without monarchs (e.g., Ireland, Israel),
						the nearly-powerless head of state who fulfills a similar role is usually
						called the President. This proposal follows that model, although
						“let’s keep the title of ‘President’ but strip it of every power
						the President currently has” leads, admittedly, to some clunky drafting.
					</span>
			</p>
			<h3>The Cabinet</h3>
			<p class="newsec">
				A serving officer of the Cabinet may be classified as a
				confirmed officer, an interim officer, or a caretaker officer.
				Confirmed officers have been appointed or confirmed in their
				office by the House of Representatives in the current term of
				the House. Interim officers have been appointed by the President
				but not confirmed by the House. Caretaker officers were
				appointed before the most recent House elections and have not been
				confirmed or reappointed since then.
			</p>
			<p>
				While the House is not in session, the President may appoint officers
				to the Cabinet to fill vacant seats and replace caretaker officers.
				In making such appointments, the President should exercise good judgment,
				choosing people who are likely to retain the confidence of the House.<label
					for="sn-prezpower" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
					<input type="checkbox" id="sn-prezpower" class="margin-toggle" />
					<span class="sidenote">
						There is one corner case (as the geeks say) where a President could
						exercise significant discretionary power: If, as a result of inter-party
						squabbling, the House was deadlocked, it would not be able to form a
						majority to override whoever the President had chosen for the Cabinet.
					</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				When in session, the House may confirm interim or caretaker officers, or
				replace them.
			</p>
			<p class="newsec">
				The Cabinet must include at least five distinct persons:
				a Secretary of State, who shall direct the
				foreign relations of the United States;
				a Secretary of Defense, who shall act as Commander-in-Chief of the
				armed forces; an Attorney General, who shall represent the
				executive branch before the civil and criminal courts;
				a Secretary of the Treasury, who shall faithfully discharge the financial
				obligations of the United States; and a Secretary General,<label
					for="sn-secgen" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
					<input type="checkbox" id="sn-secgen" class="margin-toggle" />
					<span class="sidenote">
						I should call this person “Prime Minister,” but I just couldn’t.
					</span> who shall assume all
				executive obligations not otherwise specified, and who shall lead the Cabinet
				as first among equals.
			</p>
			<p>
				The House may create or remove other Cabinet positions, and assign other
				executive responsibilities to each office, except as provided for in the
				following Section.
			</p>
			<p class="newsec">
				To replace a confirmed officer of the Cabinet, or to remove a
				Cabinet position held by a confirmed officer, or to reduce the
				power of a Cabinet position held by a confirmed officer,
				requires approval of either the officer affect, or of a majority
				of all House members duly seated and sworn.<label
					for="sn-majority" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
					<input type="checkbox" id="sn-majority" class="margin-toggle" />
					<span class="sidenote">
						That is, not the “more yes votes than no votes” majority
						in usual parliamentary procedure.
					</span>
			</p>
			<p class="newsec">
				The Cabinet may, by a two-thirds majority, expel one of its own officers.
				Such an officer, once expelled, may not be appointed to any Cabinet position
				until a new term of the House begins.
			</p>
			<p class="newsec">
				Members of the Cabinet may simultaneously be members of Congress, but may
				have no other private or public office.
			</p>
			<h3>The President</h3>
			<p class="newsec">
				The President of the United States shall hold office for a term of seven years,
				and may not serve for more than one term.
			</p>
			<p>
				Within six months of a new presidential term, or as soon as possible after
				the presidency becomes vacant,
				the House of Representatives and the Senate shall choose the President by
				meeting jointly as the Electoral College, in which each member of Congress
				casts a single vote.
			</p>
			<p class="newsec">
				The office of the President of the United States shall be ceremonial,
				ministerial, and non-political. The President shall only have such discretion
				as is explicitly granted by this Article, or by laws passed after this Article
				comes into effect.
			</p>
			<p class="newsec">
				The President shall sign all laws duly passed by Congress.
			</p>
			<p>
				The President shall sign treaties, appoint ambassadors, and receive
				foreign ambassadors and other public ministers, upon
				the recommendation of the Secretary of State; commission
				officers of the armed forces upon the recommendation of the
				Secretary of Defense; appoint judges upon the recommendation of
				the Attorney General; make other appointments upon the
				recommendation of the Secretary General, or whatever Cabinet
				officer is empowered by law to make such recommendations.<label
					for="sn-appointments" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
					<input type="checkbox" id="sn-appointments" class="margin-toggle" />
					<span class="sidenote">
						This eliminates the process for nominees to be confirmed by the Senate,
						but the experience of the last few decades suggests that there really
						is no procedural compromise between “the Senate shall courteously defer
						to the President’s choice” and “if the Senate is controlled by the party
						opposed to the President’s, then it will deny confirmation, because it can.”
					</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				The President has the discretion to commute a capital punishment under
				the laws of the United States to life in prison without parole; and, only upon
				application by the the Secretary General and at least one other
				officer of the Cabinet, may grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against
				the United States, except in cases of impeachment.
			</p>
			<p class="newsec">
				The office of Vice-President of the United States is hereby abolished.<label
					for="sn-vp" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
					<input type="checkbox" id="sn-vp" class="margin-toggle" />
					<span class="sidenote">
						You won’t miss it.
					</span>
				In the event of the President’s death, resignation, incapacity, or impeachment,
				the presiding officer of the Senate shall serve as acting President.
			</p>
			<h2>Reorganization of the Judicial Branch</h2>
			<p class="newsec">
				The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court,
				such Circuit Courts of Appeals as Congress has established or may later establish,
				and such inferior courts as Congress has established or may later establish.
				Each seat on the Supreme Court shall correspond to one of the Circuit Courts of
				Appeals, and nobody shall be appointed to the Supreme Court without having
				served for at least five years on the corresponding Circuit Courts of Appeals.<label
					for="sn-scotus" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
					<input type="checkbox" id="sn-scotus" class="margin-toggle" />
					<span class="sidenote">
						Requiring Supreme Court nominees to have prior service on an appeals court
						is a small-c conservative measure: it makes it harder for the executive to
						make the judicial system change course at a radical speed. It also ensures
						that every Supreme Court nominee have some kind of track record dealing with
						controversial questions.
					</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				Congress may by law regulate the standards that a judicial candidate must meet
				before being nominated by the Attorney General.
			</p>
			<p class="newsec">
				Every two years, on a date to be determined by Congress, if no vacancies have
				been created in the Supreme Court during the preceding two years, the eldest
				member of the Supreme Court shall be obliged to retire.
			</p>
			<h2>Campaign Finance Reform</h2>
			<p class="newsec">
				Congress and the States shall have the power to regulate and set limits on
				all election contributions and expenditures, including a candidate’s own
				spending, and to authorize the establishment of political committees to
				receive, spend, and publicly disclose the sources of those contributions and
				expenditures.<label
					for="sn-finance" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
					<input type="checkbox" id="sn-finance" class="margin-toggle" />
					<span class="sidenote">
						This is lifted verbatim from an amendment proposed in 2011 by
						Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ted Deutch.
					</span>
			</p>
			<h2>Amendments</h2>
			<p class="newsec">
				Congress may, in the same way that it passes a law, propose a
				constitutional amendment to be ratified by referendum.<label
					for="sn-amendments" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
					<input type="checkbox" id="sn-amendments" class="margin-toggle" />
					<span class="sidenote">
						On paper, the existing US Constitution is very difficult to amend: you
						need two thirds of each house of Congress and then three fourths of the
						state legislatures. In practice, there is a much easier path: find
						judges who believe that the provisions you want are <em>already</em>
						in the Constitution, when properly interpreted, and elevate those judges
						to the Supreme Court. Making the on-paper process easier might
						prevent interest groups from taking the under-the-table route of amendment.
					</span> The
				several States shall vote on this proposal at least one year,
				but no less than six years, after Congress approves the
				proposal. Every citizen eligible to vote for members of the
				House of Representatives shall be eligible to vote in such a
				referendum. The amendment shall be ratified if it is approved by
				a majority of votes in the United States at large, and also by
				majorities of votes in more than half of the several States.<label
					for="sn-majority" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

					<span class="sidenote">
						This “double majority” requirement for a constitutional amendment

			</p>
			<p>
				An amendment proposed by referendum may not deprive any State, without
				its consent, of its equal suffrage in the Senate.
			</p>
			<h2>Transitional Provisions</h2>
			<p class="newsec">
				At the time this Article comes into effect, the sitting President of the
				United States shall become the Secretary General of the Cabinet; the sitting
				Vice-President of the United States shall become the Deputy Secretary General
				of the Cabinet; and the president pro tempore of the Senate shall serve as
				acting President until the Electoral College meets to choose a President.
			</p>
			<p>
				The terms of the Senators and Representatives who are in office at the time
				that this Article comes into effect shall be extended as necessary to comply
				with the provisions of this Article.
			</p>
			<p>
				All judges, Cabinet officers, and civil servants who are in office at the time
				that this Article comes into effect shall remain in office.
			</p>
			<p>
				All laws passed by the United States and its subdivisions, and all debts and
				contracts entered into by the United States government, shall remain in effect,
				except that any clause empowering the President of the United States to make
				official acts shall be construed to require the consent of the appropriate
				Cabinet officer.
