<b> Summary:</b>  I seek a technical communication career where I can apply my knowledge of writing, chemistry, teaching, and laboratory work.  As my breadth of experience demonstrates, I am a well-organized self-starter.  With my knack for learning software, I can contribute to a project as soon as I start it.
