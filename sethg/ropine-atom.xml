<![CDATA[<p>As the Midrash says, there are seventy faces of Torah. I have chosen to follow a certain path within Orthodox Judaism, but I’m willing to admit that other paths are also valid. In particular, if other Jewish men and women find spiritual benefit from practicing a higher level of gender segregation than I favor, they should live and be well. To paraphrase a certain Chinese sage, I tolerate those who are tolerant; I also tolerate those who are intolerant.</p>

	<p>Up to a point.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2011/09/terrorism-in-bet-shemesh.html">Vandalizing an elementary school and harrassing eight-year-old girls</a> is not, by any reasonable construction, a face of Torah, or for that matter, a face of ordinary human decency. I am glad to see that the Rabbinical Council of America and the Orthodox Union (the mainstream American Orthodox rabbinic and lay organization, respectively) have <a href="http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=105667">condemned the violence and called on the Israeli police to suppress it</a>.</p>

	<p>Some people in the wider Jewish and secular worlds, seeing that both I and the <i>kanna‘im</i> [zealots] identify ourselves as “Orthodox”, might think that they are acting on behalf of my own principles. Not only do I want to disassociate myself from them, but I feel that they, along with the regular charedi<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn7509846244efd52b34e895">1</a></sup> leadership, want to disassociate from me. Look at how Agudath Israel of America, the most prominent American institution representing charedim, <a href="http://www.lakewoodlocal.com/2011/12/28/agudah-statement-on-recent-happenings-in-beit-shemesh/">comments on the events</a>. Condemning the violence is their warm-up act, but the main event is condemning something else:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Lost in all the animus and ill will, unfortunately, is the concept ostensibly at the core of the controversy: the exalted nature of tzenius, or Jewish modesty. Judaism considers human desires to constitute a sublime and important force, but one whose potential for harm is commensurate with its potential for holiness.</p>
		<p>In a society like our own, where the mantra of many is, in effect, “anything goes,” many charedi Jews, men and women alike, see a need to take special steps – in their own lives and without seeking to coerce others – to counterbalance the pervasive atmosphere of licentiousness, so as to avoid the degradation of humanity to which it leads.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Reading that statement, you’d never know that the girls in question—primary-school students being called “shiksa” and “perutza [slut]” by grown men—<em>are, themselves, Orthodox</em>. The <i>kanna’im</i> would be just as despicable, of course, if they directed their insults at secular Jews or, for that matter, Gentiles. But the Agudah’s press agent compounds the insult by treating this as an affair with only three parties: the regular charedi community, who are good guys; the <i>kanna’im</i>, who are bad guys; and the smutty secular folk, who are also bad guys, but for a different reason. So which team, in this formulation, do <em>the victims</em> belong to? Hint: not the regular charedi community.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn7509846244efd52b34e895"><sup>1</sup> The term “ultra-Orthodox” is often used to describe these folks. Many of them consider the phrase pejorative, and I myself am not fond of the implication that a community is “more Orthodox” than my own just because its members are outwardly more distinct from the mainstream.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, Fred Wilson, a prominent New York venture capitalist, <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/11/bitcoin.html">had some kind words for Bitcoin</a>, the crypto-currency that is “mined” by computers solving progressively harder math problems:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>We are quite taken with the idea of a currency that is not controlled by governments and central bankers and that is based on faith in an algorithm and a network instead of the &#8220;full faith and credit&#8221; of a country.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Then a friend of mine remarked that the place where she gives blood rewards her with “points”, which in turn can be redeemed for Wal-Mart gift cards.  And then it hit me: the true anarcho-currency for the 21st century—</p>

	<p><strong><span class="caps">BLOODCOIN</span>.</strong></p>

	<p>As an asset to link to currency, transfusable human blood has a very convenient property: its supply is roughly proportional to the population, instead of being fixed for all time (Bitcoin), fluctuating with the vagaries of mining technology (gold), or subject to the whim of a central bank (fiat). Of course, it has a very <em>in</em>convenient property, too: it is perishable. But we can work around this.</p>

	<p>Given a blood bank <i>b</i>, a type <i>t</i> and a date <i>d</i>, the bloodcoin <i>C(b, t, d)</i> can be redeemed at <i>b</i> for one unit of type-<i>t</i> whole blood that was made available for transfusion on or before <i>d</i>.  A bloodcoin, like a <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/life/food-and-drink/black-market-mooncakes-china">Chinese moon cake voucher</a>, is worthless if you sit on it too long: refrigerated blood can only keep for about three weeks. So if you want to hold a bloodcoin as a store of value, you want <i>d</i> to be as late as possible. But blood banks release their supply in <acronym title="last in, first out"><span class="caps">LIFO</span></acronym> order, so if you need actual blood for a transfusion, and the bank has some blood left over from yesterday, a bloodcoin dated yesterday is just as good as a bloodcoin dated today.</p>

	<p>So once bloodcoins are established, we can set up a spot market, where health-care institutions buy the oldest coins that are backed by specie in the fridge, blood banks issue new coins to keep up with each day’s donations, and middlemen buy and sell for all the days in between.  If you just want to keep a balance in your checking account, your broker can just keep rolling over your coins, trading in yesterday’s bloodcoins for today’s as necessary, in the same way that a money-market manager will juggle CDs of different maturities.  The free market would no doubt settle on one blood type as a reference benchmark, and use it as the basis for quoting other blood types, not to mention other commodities.</p>

	<p>All we need is a trusted auditor to certify the purity and safety of each blood bank’s reservoir, and voila! a currency backed by a truly valuable natural resource. As an added bonus, during recessions, we can expect a certain loosening of the money supply, since there will be more people willing to, shall we say, cash in their crimson. It’s a monetary reform that Austrians, Keynesians, and bleeding-heart liberals can all unite behind.</p>

	<p>If Mr. Wilson or the American Enterprise Institute or <a href="http://www.randpaul2010.com/">Dr. Rand Paul</a> wants to take me on as a consultant, I’m sure we can come to some mutually satisfactory arrangement. Heck, I’m not just sure, I’m A-positive.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>If the Occupy Wall Street movement has done nothing else, it has pushed the mainstream media to actually <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1111/Occupy_Wall_Street_is_winning.html">talk about income inequality</a>. Of course, now that the encampments have been rousted in New York, Oakland, and elsewhere, the punditocracy is free to return to its previous obsession, Teh Deficit. Better still, the Congressional deficit-busting “supercommittee” is approaching its deadline, with no deal in sight, so we can expect to see lots of hand-wringing about Congress’s bipartisan failure to reduce Teh Deficit.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn14354290374ec478e2a3c81">1</a></sup></p>

	<p>Allow me, then to speak up for Teh Deficit.</p>

	<p>Most of the rhetoric on this subject employs the metaphor of a household budget: just as your family must trim its spending to match its income, so too, a prudent government should keep its expenditures in line with its receipts. The problem with this metaphor can be summarized in three words: <em>Countries are immortal.</em></p>

	<p>Adults of working age can expect, at some point in their lives, to drop dead. Worse, <em>before</em> we drop dead, we expect to spend some years in retirement, either from choice or from medical necessity. In other words, at some point in the future, we will be spending more than we earn. Therefore, as long as we are hale and hearty, we should earn more than we spend.</p>

	<p>None of this applies to countries.  The last time the US Federal government was debt-free was in <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/04/15/135423586/when-the-u-s-paid-off-the-entire-national-debt-and-why-it-didnt-last">1835</a>. In other words, some component of the national debt has been rolled over, from one bond to another, for the past 175 years. Sovereigns that owe money to foreign investors can dismember themselves (passing on their obligations to their successor states), swallow one another up, or choose to default, but they don’t <em>die of old age</em>. </p>

	<p>Instead, the fortunes of modern governments are tied to the boom-and-bust cycles of capitalism. When times are good, the country is flush with taxable income and profits, investors are eager to support new or expanding business, and fewer people depend on government aid. During recessions, the reverse is true. For reasons like this, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics">Keynes</a> argued that when economic conditions are poor, deficit spending is not a moral failure or a concession to political pandering, but a positive good. The budget-balancing<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn3510048864ec478e2a5bc3">2</a></sup> can come during the boom times.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, for the last decade, the US has been doing the reverse. We had an economic boom in which budget surpluses were actually in sight, and then instead of milking the boom to balance the budget, we got <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/05/chart-bush-policies-dominant-cause-of-debt.php">tax cuts</a>. When the worst recession in 80 years struck, the elite obsession with budget-balancing, and the attitude that we deserve to suffer for the excesses of the past, has inhibited efforts (both in the US and Europe) to provide meaningful economic stimulus. Indeed, in the US, &#8220;stimulus&#8221; has practically become a dirty word.</p>

	<p>To its credit, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/joint_committee_reportfact_sheet.pdf">the President’s economic growth proposal</a> recognizes Keynesian priorities by front-loading the tax cuts and benefits that reduce unemployment, and scheduling tax increases for later, by which point (we hope) the economy will be stronger. But as a political strategy, the Democrats concede too much to their opponents, because they do not push back against the attitude that Teh Deficit, always and everywhere, must be a Bad Thing.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn14354290374ec478e2a3c81"><sup>1</sup> Alternatively, we may see hand-wringing about the defense cuts that will be triggered in 2012 in the absence of a deal, either because the defense budget is composed of magic pixie dollars that can be borrowed without affecting Teh Deficit, or because <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/10/republicans-cry-uncle-on-spending-when-cuts-hit-home.php">Keynesian economics only applies to defense spending</a>, or because spending three times as much on defense as China and Russia <em>combined</em> is a national priority that is even more urgent than Teh Deficit.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn3510048864ec478e2a5bc3"><sup>2</sup> One could argue that a government run on Keynesian lines should be <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/07/an-unbalanced-budget-amendment.html">running <em>surpluses</em> during economic expansions</a>, so that over the long run, the average deficit is zero. I personally think that would be a good idea, but I do not recall seeing this explicitly stated in Keynes’s <i>General Theory</i>.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Mishnah <i>Bava Metzia</i> 2:8 (this is in the chapter discussing the laws of returning lost objects to their rightful owner; cf. Deuteronomy 22:1–3):</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Someone who finds [lost] scrolls should read from them once every thirty days. And if he does not know how to read, he should roll them. But he should not learn from them at first, and another person should not read with him&#8230;.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Bartenura:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><i>Once every thirty days</i>, because they will grow moldy if left unopened, and all their scrolls were made like one sheet. <i>Roll them</i>, from beginning to end, to let the air in. <i>At first</i>, something that he never learned before, because he will have to leave them before him&#8230;.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Ikkar Tosefot Yom Tov:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>These words apply to books of Scripture, because for someone who has already learned them, it is enough to just read them, but someone who is learning them for the first time needs to make a great effort, and this effort damages the scrolls. But now that we write the Oral Law, and someone who learns a chapter of it a hundred times needs to study it in great depth like in the beginning. On the contrary, anyone who is a great expert needs to study in great depth the laws he needs to learn, and he is like one who is learning for the first time. [Thus says] Netzach Yisrael in the name of Nachmanides.</p>

	<p>tl;dr The proper way to care for a book, even a book that belongs to someone else, is to read it. How very Jewish.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>In the aftermath of this week’s budget-cutting, debt-ceiling-raising compromise, both liberal Democrats and Tea Party Republicans have excoriated their respective leaders, charging that those leaders were snookered by the other side. The more I think about what happened, the more I believe that the Tea Party folks are right: Speaker Boehner got taken to the cleaners.</p>

	<p>In order to understand why this is a win for the Democrats, we need to understand two things: what President Obama wanted (which, unfortunately, is not what the liberal wing of the Democratic Party wants) and what, in the absence of the debt ceiling, the Republicans could have acheived.</p>

	<p>Once upon a time, there was a faction of the Republican Party known as the “Rockefeller Republicans”. They were liberal on social issues, but they tempered their liberalism with fiscal prudence, and they did not share Democrats’ distrust of big business. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Percy">Chuck Percy</a>, who like Obama was a Senator from Illinois, was one such. These days, we have another word for politicians with these views. We call them “Democrats”. And Obama is one such: his Senate voting record places him <a href="http://voteview.com/Clinton_and_Obama.htm">squarely in the middle of his party</a>.</p>

	<p>As the country is coming out of its most severe recession since the 1930s, Obama’s emphasis on deficit-cutting is horrid economics, but Hoovernomics is practically an article of faith among all but the most liberal Democrats these days. And unlike creationism and global-warming denial, balanced budgets are not just an American obsession: for example, the Conservative/LibDem coalition government in Britain <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/world/europe/24britain.html">is going the full monty for austerity</a>, and so far things are turning out exactly as Keynes would have predicted, i.e., <a href="http://www.myfinances.co.uk/savings/2011/08/04/obr-says-uk-economy-unlikely-to-meet-2011-growth-target">badly</a>.</p>

	<p>Furthermore, the Republican alternative is even worse. Since Reagan, the Republican fiscal strategy has been consistent: cut taxes, especially for the wealthy; run up the tab with loopholes and giveaways for Republican interest groups; when politically necessary, concede to Democrats on spending increases, but not on tax increases; blame the Democrats for the out-of-control deficit. The Medicare prescription-drug benefit, signed by Bush the Younger, is an excellent example of this phenomenon. It added $50 billion a year to the deficit at a time when Congress was slashing taxes. It provides a real benefit to seniors, but does so by subsidizing their private insurance premiums, and it left money on the table for Big Pharma by forbidding Medicare from negotiating a discount on the drugs it purchased. And eleven Democratic Senators (plus Jim Jeffords) voted for it.</p>

	<p>Given that history, if the debt ceiling had not been in play this summer, what kind of budget would the Republicans be maneuvering to pass? I can easily imagine them retreating from the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/05/paul-ryan-budget-analysis-numbers_n_844946.html">Ryan budget</a> to something that “merely” makes the Bush tax cuts permanent, slashes Medicare, and repeals key components of Obamacare (e.g., the individual mandate). Then they would just need to tweak that budget enough to convince ten Democrats in the Senate that voting for this bill is better than letting the government shut down. Liberal Democrats would fume, moderates would be grateful that the carnage wasn’t worse, and Republicans would use Democratic profligacy as a key talking point in the 2012 elections.</p>

	<p>A key concept in negotiation theory is the BATNA—Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement. In the absence of a debt ceiling, the Democratic leadership’s <span class="caps">BATNA</span> is hampered by Republican control of the House, weak Democratic party discipline in the Senate, and the looming threat of a government shutdown.</p>

	<p>The above scenario, I think, answers a question that has vexed many liberals. Why didn’t the Democrats raise the debt ceiling while they still had Congress? Why didn’t Obama take an uncompromising stand in favor of a “clean” debt-ceiling bill, with no strings attached? <strong>Because they didn’t want such a bill.</strong> They wanted to tie Republicans to the mast of deficit reduction, even if they had to tie their own party at the same time.</p>

	<p>I believe that Obama’s preferred nice-guy result, in the “grand bargain” negotiations with Boehner, was something that would have reduced the long-term deficit with a combination of entitlement reforms (e.g., the rumored hike in the age for Medicare eligibility) and tax increases on the wealthy. The former would have pissed off the Democratic base and the latter would have pissed off the Republican base, but both sides would have gone into the 2012 elections with their sacred cows equally wounded. But Boehner wouldn’t play along, or couldn’t get his caucus to play along. So they ended up with a stopgap deal that, in the default case (i.e., the case where the “Supercongress” committee can’t make a budget),  <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> mess with key entitlement programs and <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> raise taxes&#8230; until the Bush tax cuts expire, at which point both middle- and upper-class taxpayers get socked.</p>

	<p>But now the Republicans are tied to the mast, because the Supercongress has to come up with a budget that <em>actually cuts the deficit by $1.5 trillion relative to current law</em>. If the Republicans on the committee say “hey, we’d like to make the Bush tax cuts permanent”, the Democrats will say “that’s going to add <a href="http://taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/1001438-tax-cuts-debate.pdf">over $300 billion per year</a> to the deficit; how are you going to make up for that <em>and</em> meet our deficit-reduction targets?” If the Republicans say “we were thinking of cutting Medicare”, the Democrats can simply say “no”, secure in the knowledge that if negotiations break down, taxes on the wealthy will automatically go up, but Medicare benefits will be preserved. In general, <a href="http://www.thepeoplesview.net/2011/08/paul-krugman-is-political-rookie-or-how.html?spref=fb">as this blogger observes</a>, the automatic triggers in the debt-ceiling deal put a squeeze on industries that primarily donate to Republicans. In short, the Democrats’ <span class="caps">BATNA</span> in the next round has greatly improved.</p>

	<p>As an extra bonus, the intra-party Republican tussles over the debt-ceiling deal has revealed how weak Republican party discipline is in the House. If the <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/08/house-passes-major-legislation-to-raise-debt-limit.php">66 Republican Representatives who voted against the deal</a> are equally indisposed to vote for the Supercongress’s proposal, then Boehner will need to court not just one Democrat on the Supercongress, but 44 Democrats on the House floor, to get the actual deficit-reduction deal to become law.</p>

	<p>If Boehner had been more politically savvy, he would have gone for the clean debt-ceiling increase.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<blockquote>
    <p>
      The missionaries’ suntans contrasted with the rain falling
      outside Angela’s porch.  They wore raincoats with the same lemon
      color as the house’s trim, and their facial expressions reminded
      her of puppies begging for attention.  As the woman held up a
      plastic-bagged copy of <i>The Watchtower</i>, Angela rubbed
      sleep out of her eyes.  Maybe she could invite them to use the
      bathroom and get a drink of water?  Should she check with Mike
      first, or just assume that her husband had slept through the
      ringing doorbell?  As she debated with herself, she noticed that
      the man’s face was changing: his cheekbones rose, his nose
      widened, and his skin bronzed to match Angela’s own complexion.
      “Derek?” she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alien winked and put one finger to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come in come in.”  Angela held the door wide for them.  As they
      climbed the narrow, dimly lit staircase, she heard a door open
      on the second-floor landing.  She called up, letting adrenaline
      power her voice: “It’s OK, sweetie.  Old college friends.”
      Derek lowered the raincoat hood.  His hair curled as it
      retracted into the scalp.  The woman followed him, and Angela
      took up the rear.  “You must be Kimberly?”  Angela whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kimberly looked bashfully over her shoulder.  Her lips had
      tinted themselves an un-Christian shade of red.  “Sorry if we
      woke you.  Your phones were off.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We were up late,” Angela admitted.  “Just talking.”
    <p>
      Safely inside the apartment, Kimberly embraced Angela’s husband,
      a white man with a shaved head and a Vandyke beard.  Angela
      kissed Derek on the lips, muttered something about how awful she
      looked, and took both raincoats to the bathroom.  Between
      flushing the toilet and turning on the sink, she heard Mike’s
      question “So, honey, how’s that invasion of Earth coming
      along?”, and Kimberly’s laughter.
    </p>

	<p>At some point while researching a story, I came across information on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companion_plants">companion planting</a>. One of the suggestions from that page was that plants in the <i>Allium</i> family, including onions, are good to plant with fruit trees, because they deter pests. So when we had a couple of onion bulbs destined for the compost bin, I offered to plant them next to the apple trees in our yard.</p>

	<p>I don’t know if they are doing any good for the trees—given everything else in our yard, slugs and aphids are the least of their problems—but since I got to see what the flowering stem of an onion looks like, I can’t say the effort was wasted.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Go-F-Sleep-Adam-Mansbach/dp/1617750255">insomniac children</a> is a hot topic these days, I ought to share a story of our own adventures in this department.</p>

	<p>When our youngest son was two years old, recently transferred from crib to toddler bed, he discovered the joys of getting out of that bed, opening his own door, and visiting his parents. The standard parenting-manual advice for such situations is to deposit the straying child back in his own room, with as little drama as possible, but we feared that no matter how well we kept our poker faces, he was having such a good time with this game that he would not bore quickly.</p>

	<p>Screaming at the kid was a tempting proposition, and would have been cathartic in the short term, but probably would not have solved the problem in the long run.</p>

	<p>So we employed a technique from the behaviorist canon: “reinforcing the positive opposite”. Rather than <em>dis</em>couraging him from <em>getting up</em>, we tried to <em>en</em>courage him to <em>stay down</em>. (Or at least, to stay in his room.) The first step was to reward him for staying in his room, with the door closed, for thirty seconds. For the first few days of the exercise, even this was an accomplishment worth praising.</p>

	<p>I stayed in the hallway behind the closed door, mentally counting down. If the two-year-old emerged, I put him back in bed, poker-faced, and restarted the count. If he stayed in his room for the alotted time, I went in, praised him effusively for staying put, reminded him that more cuddling would be his if he would stay in bed, and began counting down again from a higher number. One minute&#8230; two minutes&#8230; three&#8230; five&#8230; eight&#8230; thirteen&#8230; no, I’m not obsessed with the Fibonacci sequence, why do you ask? If he seemed pretty solid about staying in bed for one minute on Monday night, then we might dare to begin Tuesday night with a two-minute timer.</p>

	<p>It took a few months of this discipline to break him of the get-out-of-bed game entirely, and I did occasionally wonder if the positive reinforcement was really an improvement over the “just send him back whenever he gets out” technique. However, three years later, all three kids go to bed at the same time, and the youngest one reliably falls asleep before either of his big brothers. Indeed, he falls asleep so promptly that on Saturday and Sunday mornings, he <em>wakes up</em> before either of his brothers, and at seven o’clock, he drags me out of bed, demanding breakfast.</p>

	<p>Be careful what you wish for.</p>]]>

The view out the window is a pixel-perfect Arizona sunset. The bodyguards who flank him do not lower their revolvers. Neither do you.</p>
		<p>“The password, Mr. Franklin,” repeats Dmitri. His weapon is still fixed on the bodyguard across the room, a stout, sunburned man whose paisley vest is straining at its buttons.<br />
Franklin says nothing.</p>
		<p>“Don’t think your simulated henchmen frighten us. If they kill us here in the Zone, we just wake up, relaunch our apps, and find you again. If—”</p>
		<p>The smoke, overpowering the smell of sawdust, makes your eyes water. Franklin laughs. His eyes dart between you and Claire. “If they kill you in the Zone, you <em>wake up</em>? Did this charlatan—” he gestured with the cigar— “actually tell you that? My dear, dear friends, once you get beyond the practice levels, if your avatar dies in the Zone, your real body dies along with it.”</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Matthew Yglesias <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2011/05/newt-gingrich-campaigning-from-an-alternate-reality-sees-third-wife-as-key-asset/">points and jeers</a> at an <span class="caps">NYT</span> article on how Newt Gingrich is trying to sell his third wife as an asset to his Presidential campaign. Gingrich, one of the leaders of the effort to impeach Bill Clinton for his marital misdeeds, negotiated the terms of his divorce with his first wife while she was recovering from uterine-cancer surgery. He broke up with his <em>second</em> wife after <em>she</em> had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Callista Bisek, his third wife, had been Newt’s mistress during his second marriage, but she convinced him to become Roman Catholic, so I guess there won’t be a third divorce.</p>

	<p>Gingrich’s marital adventures are a perfect metaphor for the Republican model of governance. If you are fit and attractive, then handsome and powerful Uncle Sam will be happy to let you decorate his arm; once you actually need his help, he will cut you loose.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>On the way home from work, I saw an advertisement plastered across the back of a bus, announcing that <a href="http://www.ebiblefellowship.com/may21/">the Christian Day of Judgment will come on May 21st</a>. This led me to wonder:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>When someone sells ad space to anyone annoucing an impending apocalypse, should they demand payment in full up front?</li>
		<li>If the vendor normally sells space on more generous terms (e.g., net 90 days), can the apocalyptic purchaser sue for religious discrimination?</li>
	</ol>

<![CDATA[<p>Like many people in the Orthodox community, I receive occasional brochures from <i>Kupat Ha&#8217;ir</i>, an organization that provides financial support to poor people in Israel. Kupat Ha&#8217;ir has such a history over-the-top marketing&#8212;touting the miracles that God has performed on behalf of its donors&#8212;that last year, one prominent Lakewood rabbi described its techniques as <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/11/14/kupat-ha%E2%80%99ir%E2%80%99s-over-the-top-advertising/"><i>“gezel gamur”</i></a> [complete theft].</p>

	<p>This year, in their pre-Pesach magazine, they have outdone themselves. After the cover story quoting Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky to justify their marketing practices, they have a sequence of miracle stories. The first is about a rabbi who hired a man to flagrantly violate Israeli traffic-safety laws (towing an overwide trailer without hiring a police escort); said driver <strong>almost</strong> got arrested by the strictest traffic cop in Israel, but thanks to the rabbi&#8217;s donation to Kupat Ha&#8217;ir, the cop couldn&#8217;t find his measuring tape. The second is about a rabbi who told an Arab taxi driver to wait for him and let the meter run for ten or fifteen minutes, but returned over an hour later to find the cab gone; in the merit of a donation to Kupat Ha&#8217;ir, this rabbi recovered the <i>tefillin</i> he had left in the cab, in a way that did not give him the opportunity to pay what he owed the cabbie.</p>

	<p>If my son were on his way to study in Israel, I would make a point of looking up the &#8220;gedolei hador&#8221; who associate themselves with this charity, and advising him not to learn at any of their schools.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I’m too lazy to chase down the link in the wee hours of the morning, but I remember seeing a presentation by a team from Microsoft, arguing that user interface designers are too constrained by the desire to make everything easily accessible to a naive user. After all, they said, mastering a contemporary video game requires a lot of effort, and yet people are willing to pay for the opportunity to make just such an effort. They concluded that the people who design user interfaces for productivity applications should learn from the people who design video games.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Various news outlets have reported that a pro-life group is <a href="http://www.fox8.com/news/sns-ap-oh--ohioabortions-firstheartbeat,0,1310106.story">calling a fetus as a witness</a> before the Ohio state legislature, which is debating a bill that would outlaw abortion in any case where the embryo or fetus has a detectable heartbeat.</p>

	<p>This is incorrect reportage.</p>

	<p>First, witnesses, by definition, <em>give testimony</em>, and a fetus cannot testify to anything. A fetus can be evidence, but not a witness.</p>

	<p>Second, one does not bring a fetus to the witness stand; one brings <em>a pregnant woman</em>.</p>

	<p>I can understand why the Faith2Action is framing their legislative stunt in this particular way, but the rest of us don’t have to play along. In particular, it would have been nice if the Associated Press had reported <em>the name</em> of the woman who is coming before the committee.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>“The Blessed Ones”, for which I sought beta-readers <a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/article/married-white-man-creative-seeks-sadist">here</a>, has been rejected by <i>F&amp;SF</i> and <i>Asimov’s</i>, and I’m trying to work up the courage to submit it to Tor.com (one of the few other SF publications that will consider work above 10,000 words in length). I’ve gotten some good feedback on “Knives” (see <a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/article/in-honor-of-national-short-story-writing-month">here</a>), so after I get some other stuff out of the way I will start revising it. And while waiting for feedback on “Knives”, I wrote something else that I call “House Arrest”, a little over 5,800 words, which begins thusly:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
      The girl lifted her hands straight up as far as they could go,
      exposing bony elbows.  If she and the soldier had been standing
      toe-to-toe, her fingertips would have reached his nose.  Her
      hair was blond, like the soldier’s, but plumbline-straight
      instead of curly; a headband shaped like a row of daisies held
      it back from her high forehead.  The soldier aimed his pistol at
      her pale green Wharton School T-shirt, sighting on the <i>r</i>
      in <i>Wharton</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Please don’t hurt me,” she said.  “There’s food here.  Take
      whatever you want.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where are your parents?”  He kept his arm and his gaze steady,
      but was conscious of the loft above and behind the girl; he
      wondered if he would soon glimpse moving shadows in his
      peripheral vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl cocked her head.  “My father’s dead.  My mom’s in Long
      Island, in a nursing home.”  She waited for him to respond, and
      then smiled at him, exposing her teeth.  “My name is Tacey.
      Short for Anastasia—” she pronounced it <i>Anna-tay-shuh</i>—
      “of Washington County, daughter of Irene, daughter of Nina of
      Brooklyn.  What’s your name?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The front room measured about four meters across and three deep;
      Tacey had emerged from the bathroom door at the far side.  The
      soldier cursed himself for not looking more carefully through
      the windows before breaking in; he had assumed that with tourist
      season long over and no vehicle parked outside, the cabin must
      be empty.  He asked Tacey, “How old are you, miss?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Forty-eight.”  She started to lower one hand and then raised it
      again.  “This terminal just turned five.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You’re a housewife?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am.”  She puffed out her chest.  “I got an <span class="caps">MBA</span> from Wharton
      Online and I have a husband and I have <em>two</em> daughters.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go on,” he scoffed.  <i>Homo vestae</i> housewives, unable to
      even cross the street in the flesh, depended on neighbors for
      the kind of social contact they couldn’t get over the Net.  None
      of them would choose to plant herself in a cabin in the Maine
      forest, twenty miles from the nearest town.  The soldier asked,
      “Where are your older terminals?  Where’s the one who gave birth
      to your daughters?”  Sweat had gathered in the small of his
      back, soaking through his shirt, pinned there by his knapsack.
      His beard itched.  It was mid-September, but the hot, muggy air
      felt like August.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tacey looked the soldier up and down and let out a slow sigh.
      “Every other terminal was culled,” she said.  “It’s part of my
      sentence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your sentence?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m a convict.  This is my prison.  Well, technically, house
      arrest.”
    </p>
</blockquote>

	<p>As with the other two, if you can read it and give me your comments, I can email you a copy. I even have software that purports to translate <span class="caps">HTML</span> to various e-book formats (although the <span class="caps">PDF</span> converter doesn’t work), so if you want to read it on one of those newfangled devices, I can try to accommodate you. adTHANKSvance.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>After watching <i>Buffy</i> on <span class="caps">DVD</span>, years after all of my friends had seen it on the network, and watching <i>Babylon 5</i> on tape, and watching <i>Big Love</i> on <span class="caps">DVD</span>, and watching <i>Firefly</i> on <span class="caps">DVD</span>, and&#8230; well, every once in a while I hear that some new show is going to be premiered, and I think, aha, <em>this one</em> I will see from the beginning, so I can be a first-class member of its fan community.</p>

	<p>So I just saw the premiere of <a href="http://www.syfy.com/beinghuman/">Being Human</a> and&#8230; well, it ended on a cliffhanger and I am not rearranging my schedule to see the second episode.</p>

	<p>The main reason that <i>Buffy</i>, <i>B5</i>, etc. make for such good drama is that their protagonists actually have <em>passions</em>.  That&#8217;s what the &#8220;pro&#8221; in &#8220;protagonist&#8221; means, right? The protagonist <em>wants</em> something, and isn&#8217;t satisfied by just going through the motions of desire. <i>BH</i> had an hour to establish the motivations of its characters, and defines them in terms of what they are <em>avoiding</em>, not what they seek. The emo-pire doesn&#8217;t want to feed off live humans. The emo-wolf doesn&#8217;t want his relatives to know that he&#8217;s a werewolf.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn1798396004d3524715635c">1</a></sup> The emo-ghost doesn&#8217;t want to leave her ludicrously underpriced two-story apartment.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn3792984554d35247156745">2</a></sup></p>

	<p>Even the episode&#8217;s bad guy, über-vamp sire of emo-pire, is weak: a vampire patriarch who has apparently read too many <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/">Dr. Sears</a> books. There&#8217;s one scene where the emo-pire, who has been trying to claim that he is out of the whole predation scene, asks his sire for a significant favor, and the sire just <em>grants</em> it, without even a suggestion of &#8220;you owe me and you can be damn sure I will come back to collect on your debt&#8221;. If Vito Corelone had run his family this way, they wouldn’t have been able to take over a Rotary Club.</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t expect High Art from Hollywood, but sheesh, is a little <em>storytelling</em> too much to ask for?</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn1798396004d3524715635c"><sup>1</sup> The protagonists of <i>Big Love</i>, in the first few seasons, don&#8217;t want their neighbors to know they are polygamous&#8212;life in the closet, and the effects thereof, is a running theme&#8212;but that avoidance does not define them. They want to live as a family <em>and</em> maintain a lifestyle that resembles the middle-class <span class="caps">LDS</span> ideal <em>while</em> staying closeted.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn3792984554d35247156745"><sup>2</sup> The apartment is in a Boston neighborhood that my wife guessed as the South End, and the paying tenants are a hospital nurse and an orderly. I have an easier time suspending my disbelief in vampires.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Amy Chua&#8217;s paean to academic stage-motherhood, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704111504576059713528698754.html">“Why Chinese Mothers are Superior”</a>, has been making the rounds on teh intarwebs. I can&#8217;t add much to the commentary surrounding the op-ed itself (there&#8217;s a lot of interesting discussion <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/99339/Why-Chinese-Mothers-Are-Superior">on MetaFilter</a>), but I do want to follow up on a follow-up, as it were.</p>

	<p>On <a href="http://www.quora.com/Parenting/Is-Amy-Chua-right-when-she-explains-Why-Chinese-Mothers-Are-Superior-in-an-op-ed-in-the-Wall-Street-Journal">Quora</a>, a Chinese-American woman reprinted an email she got from Chua:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Thank you for taking the time to write me, and I&#8217;m so sorry about your sister [who was driven to overachieve and committed suicide at age 30].  I did not choose the title of the <span class="caps">WSJ</span> excerpt, and I don&#8217;t believe that there is only one good way of raising children.  The actual book is more nuanced, and much of it is about my decision to retreat from the &#8220;strict Chinese immigrant&#8221; model.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>When I finally got around to reading <i>Anathem</i>, my wife told me she was uninterested in reading it after me, because she thought Neil Stephenson did a mediocre job at character development.</p>

	<p>&#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; I told her. &#8220;He&#8217;s a geek. His characters are all geeks. His readers are all geeks. He doesn&#8217;t need to put much character development into the actual writing, because we readers know what his characters are like already.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, after I said that, I started <em>noticing how true it was</em>. <i>Anathem</i> (if you are not a geek, or if you are a geek who only got twenty pages into the book) is a novel whose central characters are very much like monks on a planet very much like Earth&#8230; except that the focus of the monks&#8217; lives is not Divine service but the study of math and physics. (Also, no celibacy.) OK, fair enough, it&#8217;s a novel about geeks. But when these monkoids have contact with the world outside their walls, everyone they have to deal with is <em>also</em> pretty damn geeky. The narrator&#8217;s sister is a machinist. When the plot turns to political machinations, the politicians the narrator interacts with are either mucketymucks in the monastic world itself, or secular politicians who are generally sympathetic to the monks.</p>

	<p>What really drove this home to me was a passage where the narrator describes a fascinating religion&#8212;the gist of which is that we are all characters in the mind of a condemned criminal, and if we don’t make our world a better place, then the convict will be executed and our world will vanish&#8212;and he concludes:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8230;[T]he Inspiration that had passed from the Innocent to the Condemned Man at the moment of her death was viral. It passed from him into each of us. Each of us had the same power to create whole worlds. The hope was that one day there would be a Chosen One who would create a world that was perfect. If that ever happened, not only would he and his world but all of the other worlds and their creators, back to the Condemned Man, would be saved recursively.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>That word &#8220;recursively&#8221; kicked me out of the story. I was no longer immersed in a world where a monk disguised as a layman was attending a service in a church of a different religion. Instead I was thinking: &#8220;The author of this novel is a geek, so of course, he cannot resist the opportunity to put in something recursive.&#8221;</p>

	<p>(Yes, I read the book all the way to the end, and I understand that part of the <em>point</em> of the story is that Arbre is in all respects a geekier world than Earth.  Even so, the characters on stage always seem to represent the geekiest end of their world&#8217;s spectrum.)</p>]]>

	</blockquote>

	<p>Suppose you are responsible for information security at a cellphone manufacturer, and you are trying to prevent information about unreleased models from leaking into the press: not just <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5520164/this-is-apples-next-iphone">prototypes</a>, but pictures, specifications, roadmaps for future product development&#8230; all sorts of things that your employer wants to keep private.</p>

	<p>Let us consider your odds.</p>

	<p>Suppose that <i>N</i> people have access to information (from plans to physical prototypes to draft marketing materials) about every new model, and each of these people will, with probability <i>p</i>, leak some of the information about this model that they receive.  We can calculate <i>p*</i>, the probability that at least one person will leak at least one privileged details, as</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><i>p* = 1 &#8211; (1-p)<sup>N</sup></i></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Since <i>N</i> is (we hope) orders of magnitude higher than <i>p</i>, it may be numerically convenient to recast it as follows:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><i>p* = 1 &#8211; </i>exp (<i>N</i> ln <i>(1-p)</i>)</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>If each employee of a cellphone manufacturer has a one-in-ten-thousand chance of leaking confidential information about each model, and information about a new model passes through a thousand hands, then the odds of a leak are about 9.5%. At two thousand employees, the probability goes up to 18%. At five thousand, it is 39%. At ten thousand, it is 63%.</p>

	<p>If a rigorous program of security education cuts <i>p</i> in half&#8212;i.e., five in a hundred thousand&#8212;then the chance of a leak among ten thousand confidantes goes back down to 39%. If <i>p</i> goes down to one in a hundred thousand, <i>p*</i> is down to 9.5%.</p>

	<p>(Yes, I was told what the actual values of <i>N</i> and <i>p*</i> are for my employer. No, I’m not telling you.)</p>

	<p>Which corporate initiative is more feasible: convincing every employee to be half as likely to leak sensitive information, or sharing that information among half as many employees in the first place?</p>

	<p class="mtb">Now let&#8217;s consider <a href="http://213.251.145.96/cablegate.html">Cablegate</a>, a series of leaks more newsworthy than next year’s smartphone specs. All the diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks were classified at the level <span class="caps">SECRET</span>/NOFORN or below, and had been distributed over <span class="caps">SIPRN</span>et, whose <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11863618">explicit purpose</a> is to make it easy for cleared government employees&#8212;an estimated 2.5 million of them&#8212;to share classified documents with one another.</p>

	<p>Given the large number of people with <span class="caps">SIPRN</span>et access, if the Russian or Chinese intelligence services wanted copies of lightly-classified documents regarding matters that they cared about, how hard would it be for them to find a mole, even without Wikileaks? What does it <em>mean</em> for the US to assert that a document would cause &#8220;serious damage&#8221; to national security if revealed, making it a felony to share that document with the general public (including, ahem, <em>us voters</em>), and then give <em>millions</em> of government employees and contractors permission to read it?</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Matthew Yglesias <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/12/the-case-for-young-earth-creationism/">proposes that we</a> &#8220;assume that God created the universe—fossils and all—to look <em>exactly like</em> that 4,000 years ago. That’s obviously a religious hypothesis rather than a scientific one, but it’s consistent with the evidence and doesn’t anyone to believe in a scientists’ conspiracy or anything.&#8221;</p>

	<p>This assumption is OK as far as philosophy goes, but it misses a crucial detail: if God did create the universe in this fashion, <em>why should I care?</em>  Young-Earth Creationism, at least in its American Christian incarnation, is not simply an allegation of facts about the universe. It casts the scientific view of the world&#8217;s origins as not merely incorrect but <em>evil</em>, because it implies a history of progress<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn2650177764d12ae279ea6e">1</a></sup> without intervention from a personal God. By contrast, in this ideology, the earth is not merely six-thousand-ish years old, but bears a six-thousand-year history of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scalzi/1969980818/in/set-72157603091357751/">paradise, decline, and redemption</a>.</p>

A co-worker of mine once reported hearing, from a certain world-famous linguist, that the syntax of natural languages must be optimal, because the human capacity for language is the product of evolution. &#8220;But&#8230; but&#8230;&#8221;, I sputtered, &#8220;evolution only tends to local&#8230; maxima&#8230;&#8221;  She rolled her eyes in sympathy.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Corporate Training Consultant Person:</p>

	<p>The next time you give one of these seminars teaching employees of multinational companies how to work better in teams, where handling cross-cultural differences is one item on the curriculum, perhaps you could lay off the ethnic humor, eh? Crude remarks about the Scots, directed at the one Scottish employee in the room, may be considered inoffensive banter in the UK, but in my own culture, it makes a bad impression.</p>

	<p><strong>&eta;</strong> I asked the Scot in question, and he said that a lone Englishman surrounded by Scots would get the same treatment in the opposite direction. So it <em>is</em> inoffensive banter in a UK context. But still, where nobody else is in on the joke, it looks bad.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>One of the most important things I learned, reading about <a href="http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=getting+to+yes&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;cid=1219984899552159820&amp;ei=Vh3jTMCgJcOBlAfe5KiCDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=product_catalog_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ8wIwAg">negotiation theory</a>, is the acronym &#8220;<span class="caps">BATNA</span>&#8221;.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">BATNA</span> stands for Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement. For example, if you are currently employed, are offered another job, and start negotiating your new salary, your <span class="caps">BATNA</span> is to keep your current job. If you are trying to negotiate a salary while your unemployment-insurance clock is ticking away, your <span class="caps">BATNA</span> is to hope to find a better offer before that clock runs out.  All other factors being equal, which circumstances give you a stronger negotiating position? That&#8217;s the power of <span class="caps">BATNA</span>.</p>

	<p>I mention this because a package of tax cuts, passed during the Bush Administration, is scheduled to expire at the end of 2010. (They are expiring because the Republicans of that era, in order to make the tax cuts filibuster-proof, passed them under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_provision#The_Budget_Act_and_the_Byrd_Rule">reconciliation</a> rules.) Republicans, since before Obama was elected, have wanted to make those cuts permanent. President Obama wants to make the cuts permanent for the &#8220;middle class&#8221; (which is to say, families making under $250K per year, which is to say, the bottom 98% of the US income distribution) but not for everyone else.</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">BATNA</span>, in this case, is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobs_and_Growth_Tax_Relief_Reconciliation_Act_of_2003#Tax_bracket_comparison">income tax rates</a>, across the board, will return to Clinton-era levels, and estates over $1,000,000 will become taxable again. In such a case, Democrats&#8217; talking points can practically write themselves: &#8220;We want to keep your taxes low, but the obstructionist Republicans in Congress are holding your tax cuts hostage, because in spite of all their talk about fiscal responsibility, they want to preserve tax cuts for millionaires.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I cannot think of any legislative controversy, likely to come up over the next two years, where the Democrats will have a stronger negotiating position. And given this leverage, what do we see?</p>

	<ul>
		<li>David Axelrod, Obama&#8217;s chief political adviser, <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/11/white-house-caves-to-gop-on-bush-tax-cuts.php">is willing</a> to extend &#8220;middle class&#8221; tax cuts permanently, and let the upper-class cuts continue for another couple of years. He justified this by saying &#8220;we have to deal with the world as we find it&#8221;.</li>
		<li>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (who, in January, will become the House Minority Leader), <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/11/pelosi-gives-bush-tax-cut-compromise-the-big-n-o.php">appears to reject this compromise</a>. The Congressional Progressive Caucus <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/11/progressives-press-dem-leaders-to-extend-middle-income-tax-cuts-only.php">stands with her</a>.</li>
		<li>Representative David Camp (R-Michigan), who will be Ways and Means Committee chairman, <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/11/gops-top-tax-guy-republicans-will-block-permanent-middle-class-tax-cut.php?ref=fpb">doesn&#8217;t like the Obama compromise, either</a>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The Democrats, over the last few years, have a shown a distressing tendency to prepare for conflict by postponing it, as if the party astrologer had assured them that in a few months the stars will be better-aligned for victory. (That is why health care reform passed 2010, rather than in 2009.) I hope Pelosi can rally enough other Democrats to their side to prevent this from happening again. May the Democratic leaders have the courage to look their Republican counterparts in the eye and say, &#8220;Go ahead. Vote against a middle-class tax cut. Make our day.&#8221;</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>One reason I haven’t been blogging much recently is that I&#8217;ve been trying to spend more time working on my fiction writing.  I got so many helpful comments on <a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/article/married-white-man-creative-seeks-sadist">my last submission</a> that not only am I prepared to revise it and look for a publisher, but I wrote <em>something else</em>, and I am ready to share a draft of that something else with whoever is willing to send back a critique within a month or so.</p>

	<p>This time around I actually tracked how much time I was spending, usually working in sixty-minute blocks, so I can report that the process from outline to ready-for-beta draft took just under 31 hours.  Yeah, I can write forty thousand words in a month&#8230; and delete thirty-two thousand of those words.</p>

	<p>My newest dubious creation (total length: approx. 7,600 words) begins as follows:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>I promised you in the hospital that I would write you every day, and I’m sorry I missed a day, but last night I couldn’t find my computer.  I guess it would serve me right if boyscript becomes meaningless to you by the time this letter reaches you.  Just in case, though, I will write down as much as I can now, starting with when I arrived for my first day of high school.</p>
		<p>Getting into the building took longer than I expected, because each doorway had a teacher in front of it with a spool of rectangular lemon-yellow stickers.  Each boy got waved through the door.  Each girl had to present the teacher with her sheathed knife and get a sticker joining the handle to the scabbard.  I walked through, trying to pretend I had walked through lines like this for years, trying not to look at anyone’s weaponry.  The scar tingled on the back of my left hand.</p>
		<p>I followed the numbers painted on yellow wall tile until I came to 105, my homeroom, and only then did I notice the banner across the hallway.  Across the left side, blue paint on white paper, it said <i><span class="caps">WELCOME</span></i>.  Then, in red, sketched with the same width of brush, were a human figure with arms raised, a hand with two fingers making a V shape, and a round eye with the pupil looking to my left.  Person, hand, and eye were all drawn at the same height.</p>
		<p>I remembered seeing the same kind of script on Mom’s notepad this morning.  A row of gesticulating body parts had been stamped into her letterhead right next to <i>Elizabeth Yamamoto, M.D., Psy.D.</i>, and under that, she had pencilled in a dozen more, in the same style, and pinned the sheet to the fridge with a magnet.</p>
		<p>“What’s that?” I had asked.</p>
		<p>“Just a note to Consuela,” she had said.</p>
		<p>“A note for what?  Asking her to wash the mammoth hide after she sweeps out the cave?”</p>
		<p>Mom had given me a suspicious look and I had resolved to try really <em>really</em> hard to blend in.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Please let me know if you want to read and comment on the rest. Do not fear for my artistic ego; it has been trampled by experts.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Mishnah Bava Kamma 2:6: “A human being is always <i>mu‘ad</i> [strictly liable; see Exodus 21:36], whether he behaves accidentally, deliberately, awake, or asleep&#8230;.”</p>

	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obadiah_ben_Abraham">Bartenura</a>: “If someone is sleeping and another comes and sleeps beside him, and the second one damages the first, he is liable.  And if the first damages the second, he is exempt. And if they fall asleep together, whoever damages his fellow is liable, because they are both <i>mu‘ad</i> with respect to each other.”</p>

<![CDATA[<p>For once in, like, decades, I have actually watched the premiere (or at least, the US network premiere) of a TV show at the same time as the rest of the world, instead of watching it on <span class="caps">DVD</span> months or years later. So, a few quick reactions to <i>Sherlock</i>, to share with fellow fans:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>One of the amazing things about fiction is that if you have a main character who is <em>passionate</em> about something, the reader will identify with that character, even if the character is otherwise, ahem, flawed. David Tennant&#8217;s wild-eyed portrayal of <i>Doctor Who</i> was enough to draw me through the series, even though, let&#8217;s face it, most of the episodes had plot holes large enough to drive a planet through. It&#8217;s nice to see some <i>Who</i> writers use Benedict Cumberbatch&#8217;s acting skill to achieve a similar effect in a TV show that actually <em>has</em> a plot.</li>
		<li>Speaking of plot, it&#8217;s also nice to watch a mystery show on TV where I do not feel compelled to reach through the screen, grab the alleged master detective (or, worse, the writer) by the lapels, and scream <em>&#8220;You idiot!&#8221;</em></li>
		<li>The use of captions to show text messages on characters&#8217; phones is an interesting presentation technique: has anyone done this before? Also, the use of captioned &#8220;wet&#8221;, &#8220;dry&#8221;, etc., as Holmes examines the body.</li>
		<li>I really hope that &#8220;everyone assumes that Holmes and Watson are a gay couple, <span class="caps">NOT</span> <span class="caps">THAT</span> WE <span class="caps">THINK</span> <span class="caps">ANYTHING</span>&#8217;S <span class="caps">WRONG</span> <span class="caps">WITH</span> <span class="caps">THAT</span>, wink wink nudge nudge&#8221; does not become a running gag throughout the series.</li>

<![CDATA[<p>The newspaper of record <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/magazine/12FOB-IdeaLab-t.html?_r=1">has revealed an embarrassing correlation</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>In the ranks of captured and confessed terrorists, engineers and engineering students are significantly overrepresented&#8230;.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>I would like to reassure my readers, my friends, and the <span class="caps">FBI</span> that even though it says &#8220;software engineer&#8221; on my business card, anyone with experience in the field knows that with our profession&#8217;s reputation for overdue, slapdash, bug-infested work, &#8220;software engineering&#8221; is practically a contradiction in terms, so nobody should confuse me with a <em>real</em> engineer.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Last December, [Umar Farouk] Abdulmutallab’s attempt over Detroit&#8230;. In February, Joseph Andrew Stack, a software engineer, crashed his plane into I.R.S. offices in Austin, Tex. In March, John Patrick Bedell, an engineering grad student, opened fire at an entrance to the Pentagon. In early May, Faisal Shahzad (bachelor of science in computer science and engineering) was arrested at Kennedy Airport for a failed attempt to set off a bomb in Times Square. Also in May, Faiz Mohammad, a civil engineer, was caught at Karachi’s airport with batteries and an electrical circuit hidden in his shoes. And going back, of the 9/11 conspirators who had been educated beyond high school, eight studied engineering. As this list suggests, the phenomenon isn’t confined to Muslims or Middle Easterners&#8230;.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Well, even though Stack was a &#8220;software engineer&#8221; and Bedell majored in the subject, and even though I share an alma mater with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aafia_Siddiqui">Aafia Siddiqui</a>, I majored in political science, not in &#8220;computer science&#8221;, any engineering field or, God forbid, any <em>real</em> science.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Gambetta and Hertog found engineers only in right-wing groups — the ones that claim to fight for the pious past of Islamic fundamentalists or the white-supremacy America of the Aryan Nations (founder: Richard Butler, engineer) or the minimal pre-modern U.S. government that Stack and Bedell extolled.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>See, there&#8217;s another reason not to put me on a no-fly list: I have nothing to do with any religious fundamentalists or white supremacists or any other kind of right-wing organization. On the contrary, I am, as you all know, very liberal.  Very, very, very&#8230;</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Among Communists, anarchists and other groups whose shining ideal lies in the <em>future</em>, the researchers found almost no engineers. Yet these organizations mastered the same technical skills as the right-wingers. Between 1970 and 1978, for instance, the Baader-Meinhof gang in Germany staged kidnappings, assassinations, bank robberies and bombings. Seventeen of its members had college or graduate degrees, mostly in law or the humanities. Not one studied engineering.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>&#8230;harmless.  Well.  <em>Mostly</em> harmless.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>They say in Multiculturally Sensitive Writers&#8217; School that it&#8217;s A Good Thing to go beyond generic raceless people who will default to <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2009/03/13/mary-anne-mohanraj-gets-you-up-to-speed-part-ii/">generic white</a> in the average reader&#8217;s mind. Instead, wherever possible, give your characters ethnicities, nationalities, etc., and think about how their upbringing as African-American, or Irish, or Lithuanian-Jewish, or whatever, has molded them. If you make the effort to develop your characters along these dimensions, your stories will be the better for them.</p>

	<p>I was reminded of this principle tonight while watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226681/">Pontypool</a>, Bruce McDonald&#8217;s B-movie about a winter zombie-like infestation of a small Ontario town. The movie isn&#8217;t merely set in Canada; it doesn&#8217;t just use Canadian winter as a backdrop to the isolation of its characters; <em>Canadian bilingualism is essential to the plot</em>.</p>

	<p>OK, the acting is less than Oscar-quality, but how much interpretive nuance do you really need in a horror movie?</p>

	<p>If your tax dollars helped subsidize this film, you can be proud.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<blockquote>
		<p>And you&#8217;ve got people. Billions of people walking around like Happy Meals with legs. &#8212;Spike</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Consider the vampire as a creature bound by the Law of Conservation of Energy.</p>

	<p>According to the <a href="http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/1999-08/935553476.Me.r.html">MadSci Network</a> (how can I not trust these guys?), there are about 700 [kilo]calories in a liter of human blood. A vampire who sucks dry a human adult with five liters of blood is going to get 3,500 calories. One who believes in sustainable humaniculture, drawing at a rate no more than what the Red Cross <a href="http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/eligibility-requirements">recommends</a> for whole-blood donors, will get half a liter, i.e., 350 calories, every other month.</p>

	<p>So if the vampire needs 3,500 calories a day to sustain his or her undeath (more than the average human adult, but it makes the math easier, and heck, a vampire doesn&#8217;t spend all night sitting at a desk), he or she will need to either rotate among six hundred cooperative hosts, or take down one victim every day.  In the latter case, even if every victim is consumed after he or she reproduces, and even if vampirism is the only cause of human death, we would need a population of at least ten thousand humans to carry each vampire.  By comparison, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolves_and_moose_on_Isle_Royale">the classic study of population dynamics among moose and wolves</a>, the moose-to-wolf ratio ranges from 15–50 moose per wolf.</p>

	<p>Moose&#8230; hmm.  What if we are dealing with emo-pires who refuse, on principle, to feed off another sentient species?  It says <a href="http://www.ccwhc.ca/wildlife_health_topics/winter_tick/wintertick.php#signs">here</a> that &#8220;a 400 kilogram moose has a blood volume of about 32 litres&#8221;, so one moose could replace between five and six human hosts; a moose generation is only four or five years, so a stable population of ten thousand humans could be replaced by about a hundred and fifty moose&#8212;assuming, crucially, that the vampires would be just as successful at catching the moose as they would be at catching two-legged prey. So Maine&#8217;s population of 30,000 moose (according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moose">Wikipedia</a>) could support up to two hundred vampires, while <a href="http://www.google.com/publicdata?ds=uspopulation&amp;met=population&amp;idim=state:23000&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=population+of+maine">its human population</a> could support only a hundred and thirty.</p>

	<p>Regardless of which scenario you choose, given how much impact a single additional vampire has on the food supply, it&#8217;s hard to see why any immortal vampire would deliberately turn a human.</p>

	<p>If vampire-story authors would pay attention to these questions of population dynamics, they could enrich the genre.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<blockquote>
		<p>We regard freedom of religion as a cornerstone of the American democracy, and that freedom must include the right of all Americans – Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and other faiths – to build community centers and houses of worship.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>If we tried to use any legal maneuver to prevent this community center from being built, we would be laughed out of court.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>We categorically reject appeals to bigotry on the basis of religion, and condemn those whose opposition to this proposed Islamic Center is a manifestation of such bigotry.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Bigotry is bad, mmkay?</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>However, there are understandably strong passions and keen sensitivities surrounding the World Trade Center site.  We are ever mindful of the tragedy which befell our nation there, the pain we all still feel – and especially the anguish of the families and friends of those who were killed on September 11, 2001.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>If the events of 9/11 have made someone feel squicked by Islam, that feeling should not be classified as bigotry.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>The controversy which has emerged regarding the building of an Islamic Center at this location is counterproductive to the healing process.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>We are as high as a kite.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Therefore, under these unique circumstances,</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Our opinion regarding 9/11, like the Supreme Court&#8217;s opinion regarding the 2000 Presidential election, should never be used as a precedent for anything else.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>we believe the City of New York would be better served if an alternative location could be found.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Not that we&#8217;re offering to draw you a map or anything.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>In recommending that a different location be found for the Islamic Center, we are mindful that some legitimate questions have been raised about who is providing the funding to build it, and what connections, if any, its leaders might have with groups whose ideologies stand in contradiction to our shared values.  These questions deserve a response, and we hope those backing the project will be transparent and forthcoming.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>We have no evidence that the Islamic Center is run by terrorists, but we&#8217;re not above insinuating that such evidence might exist. We call ourselves the &#8220;Anti-Defamation League&#8221; but we&#8217;re not above defaming the Islamic Center&#8217;s leaders and donors.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>But regardless of how they respond, the issue at stake is a broader one.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>We actually don&#8217;t care whether or not the Islamic Center is run by terrorists. We just wanted to blow some smoke about that.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Proponents of the Islamic Center may have every right to build at this site,</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Then again, they may not.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>and may even have chosen the site to send a positive message about Islam.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>If so, we will strive to prevent anyone from receiving that message.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>The bigotry some have expressed in attacking them is unfair, and wrong.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Did we mention that bigotry is bad?</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>But ultimately this is not a question of rights, but a question of what is right.  In our judgment, building an Islamic Center in the shadow of the World Trade Center will cause some victims more pain – unnecessarily – and that is not right.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>We must perform a delicate balancing act between the feelings of people who, since 9/11, have become squicked by Islam (in a totally non-bigoted way), and the feelings of those &#8220;Islamic moderates&#8221; whom we used to call upon to denounce Muslim extremists. For an Islamic Center three blocks away from Ground Zero, that balance favors the non-bigots. Maybe this Center could be built four blocks away. Or maybe fourteen blocks away. Or maybe in Brooklyn. Then again, <a href="http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/27/bn_tt_baypeoplemosquerally_2010_07_02_bk.html">maybe not in Brooklyn</a>.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><i>The Anti-Defamation League, founded in 1913, is the world&#8217;s leading organization fighting anti-Semitism through programs and services that counteract hatred, prejudice and bigotry.</i></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>God help us.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee, while responding to a constituent&#8217;s concern about a Muslim community center being built in Murfreesboro, remarked that while he is all in favor of freedom of religion, &#8220;you could even argue whether being a Muslim is actually a religion, or is it a nationality, way of life, cult, whatever you want to call it&#8221;. As others have already pointed out, this is free propaganda for al-Qaeda.</p>

	<p>I, for one, would like to highlight that word &#8220;cult&#8221;, because when used among evangelical Christians, it does not always mean &#8220;organization that brainwashes its members&#8221;. Sometimes it means &#8220;organization that preaches heresy&#8221;.</p>

	<p>Back when I was researching the Boston Church of Christ, I acquired a book by Walter Martin called <a href="http://www.waltermartin.com/cults.html">The Kingdom of the Cults</a>. Martin&#8217;s catalog of &#8220;cults&#8221; includes not only the Moonies and Scientology, but also Christian Science, Baha‘i, Buddhism, and Islam. In an appendix, he seriously examines the accusation that the Seventh-Day Adventists are a cult, but ultimately declares that they are legit. Judaism and Catholicism are not mentioned at all.</p>

	<p>Ask not, fellow unwashed heathen, for whom the wingnut trolls; it trolls for thee.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Teresa Nielsen Hayden, <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/012518.html">bemoaning</a> how <span class="caps">CNN</span> requires you to sign away your digital soul in order to post a comment on its Web site, remarks:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>In the United States, we don’t have many laws protecting our personal information. We need more than we have. The alternative, the one we’ll get by default if we don’t do anything, is to have our online identities mediated by Facebook. If the government had proposed an online identity system that prone to holes, leaks, and exploits, we’d have been up in arms.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Which reminds me&#8230;</p>

	<p>In the Anglo-American legal tradition we&#8217;ve always been antsy about government officials saying &#8220;papers, please&#8221;, but <em>authentication of identity is one of the traditional functions of the state</em>. The paper trail certifying that I really am Seth Gordon, for all transactions where it really counts, terminates in two places: a birth certificate issued by the State of Illinois, and a driver&#8217;s license issued by the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles. (If I had changed my name since birth, of course, that paper trail would have taken a detour through some probate court.)</p>

	<p>The governments of <a href="http://www.id.ee/?lang=en">Estonia</a> and <a href="http://lists.openid.net/pipermail/openid-eu/2009-February/000568.html">Lithuania</a> have brought state-authenticated identity into the digital age with systems that combine a smartcard, a <span class="caps">PIN</span>, and the <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID protocol</a>. (My Web browser cannot authenticate <a href="https://openid.vrm.lt/">the Web site for Lithuania&#8217;s national OpenID provider</a>, which suggests there are a few kinks to be worked out of the system.) Why can&#8217;t the United States do the same thing?</p>

	<p>For financial and medical transactions, this would create a single strong system for logging into the Web sites of multiple banks, credit-card issuers, and so forth. For non-financial transactions, a government-backed identity broker could authenticate a user by revealing the <em>minimum</em> amount of information that a Web site operator actually needs, rather than the maximum amount that some profit-seeking broker wants to share. The government could protect citizens&#8217; privacy by offering them proxy identities: &#8220;account <i>2b740996-9919-11df-80f3-001aa0739303</i> is associated with a lawful US resident over the age of eighteen and you don&#8217;t need to know anything else about them&#8221;. And a Web site that accepted any OpenID-based authentication system could let users certify their identity through LiveJournal, <span class="caps">AOL</span>, Google, or any other private provider, so people who didn&#8217;t want to involve the government wouldn&#8217;t have to.</p>

	<p>Obviously no system is perfectly secure, and letting a single agency manage hundreds of millions of digital identities raises the spectre of catastrophic failure. However, I believe that the current way we handle digital identity, juggling dozens of half-remembered usernames and passwords, is <em>even less secure</em>, because none of the institutions managing these databases have a strong incentive to do it right, and an attacker can wreak havoc by simply penetrating whichever system is weakest. The alternative to authentication by the government is not authentication by <a href="http://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier</a>, but authentication by Facebook.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I have seen various discussions online about colonialism, and of course, these make me think about colonialism in SF&#8212;especially the kind where our planet becomes someone else&#8217;s colony.</p>

	<p>Stereotypically, in these kinds of stories, the aliens are either Bad Guys or Good Guys. If they are Bad Guys, they dominate the planet by sheer brute force, disintegrating anything that stands in their way until (in American SF) our plucky heroes find the aliens&#8217; weakness and create a glorious victory for humanity, or (in British SF) everyone dies. If the aliens are Good Guys, then they are protecting us from the baser elements of our nature until we can rise to full membership in the galactic community. The problem with the stereotypical Bad Guy scenario is that historically, colonial regimes among humans never<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn6052272854c4bb5824f1b5">1</a></sup> act purely with brute force; an effective colonial administration knows how to co-opt at least some of the natives. The problem with the stereotypical Good Guy scenario is that it uncomfortably resembles a justification for real colonialism: the aliens in these stories are, so to speak, taking up the little green man&#8217;s burden.</p>

	<p>Thinking of Good Guy aliens made me think of Octavia Butler&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilith%27s_Brood"><i>Lilith&#8217;s Brood</i> trilogy</a> (formerly titled <i>Xenogenesis</i>); I had read these books when they first came out around twenty years ago, and recalled them as a well-written and original take on the whole alien-invasion theme. The aliens in this series are the Oankali, who arrive on Earth shortly after nuclear war has wiped out most of the human population. Their schtick is to exchange genetic material with other species, so that the descendants of each contact with a new world acquire new traits. To this end, they scoop up as many nuclear-war survivors as they can and prepare them to become parents of human-Oankali hybrids. The main character of the series, Lilith Iyapo, is charged with training other humans to survive in Earth&#8217;s recreated wilderness and mediating between them and the Oankali. Over and over through the series, the Oankali remark on a &#8220;contradiction&#8221; built into the human condition: that we are both intelligent and hierarchical, and that without an injection of some Oankali genetics, this combination will doom us to self-destruction. So: Good Guy aliens. More or less.</p>

	<p>I reread <i>Dawn</i> looking for stuff about colonialism, but what struck me about the book, instead, was the gender politics.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Victims of domestic violence are frequently confined and stalked, unable to move freely, right? Lilith spends the first book on a spaceship and in the opening chapters, she can&#8217;t even open a door.</li>
		<li>Most of the humans that Lilith trains hate her for being a collaborator with the enemy. She refers to herself as a &#8220;Judas goat&#8221;, but I was reminded of a not-uncommon pattern in abusive families: Dad beats both Mom and the kids, but the kids resent Mom for not standing up to Dad.</li>
		<li>Control of sexuality and reproduction is one hallmark of domination in male-female relationships, and indeed, the Oankali decide whether or not Lilith is fertile, without even asking her opinion.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>And consider these quotes (page numbers are from the trade paperback edition of <i>LB</i>):</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;We&#8230; do need you.&#8221; Nikanj spoke so softly that Joseph leaned forward to hear. &#8220;A partner must be biologically interesting, attractive to us, and you are fascinating. You are horror and beauty in rare combination. In a very real way, you&#8217;ve captured us, and we can&#8217;t escape&#8230;.&#8221; (p. 153)</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Isn&#8217;t that one of the classic excuses for sexual assault? &#8220;She was so attractive, I couldn&#8217;t keep my hands off her.&#8221; And savor the irony of humans <em>trapped on a spaceship</em> being told &#8220;you&#8217;ve captured us&#8221;.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8230;It reached out and caught his hand in a coil of sensory arm. &#8220;I won&#8217;t hurt you. And I offer a oneness that your people strive for, dream of, but can&#8217;t truly attain alone.&#8221;</p>
		<p>He pulled his arm free. &#8220;You said I could choose. I&#8217;ve made my choice!&#8221;</p>
		<p>&#8220;You have, yes.&#8221; It opened his jacket with its many-fingered true hands and stripped the garment away from him. When he would have backed away, it held him. It managed to lie down on the bed without seeming to force him down. &#8220;You see. Your body has made a different choice.&#8221;</p>
		<p>&#8230;</p>
		<p>&#8220;Let go of me.&#8221;</p>
		<p>It smoothed its tentacles again. &#8220;Be grateful, Joe. I&#8217;m not going to let go of you.&#8221; (pp. 189–190)</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Ten pages earlier, Lilith had intervened violently to prevent one human from raping another. In this scene, though, an Oankali commits what in a human-on-human context would be clearly recognizable as date rape, using the rationale <i>he said no, but he didn&#8217;t really mean it</i>&#8212;again, a classic&#8212;and Lilith just watches approvingly.</p>

	<p>In spite of all this, the Oankali do come off as generally sympathetic characters. Perhaps they give me this impression because the human characters, throughout the series, are frequently brutal to one another&#8212;more often for the sake of conventional crimes (banditry, kidnapping, etc.) than over anything directly involving the Oankali. Like I said, the Oankali are Good Guy aliens. More or less.</p>

	<p>PS: Butler also wrote a novellette, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/bloodchi.htm">&#8220;Bloodchild&#8221;</a>, that examines human-alien family dynamics from a different angle. I recommend the <i>Lilith&#8217;s Brood</i> novels, but I think &#8220;Bloodchild&#8221; is one of the finest SF stories ever written.</p>

		<p>When Diana Rosenberg was six, she asked her father how to spell those strings of nonsense syllables that her mother said to him every morning and evening, sounds that she could not quite imitate and that didn&#8217;t resemble any language she heard in school, even on the playground.  Her father explained that men could never remember what the Five Blessings sounded like, and anyway, they weren&#8217;t exactly <em>words</em>—they were sounds that touched a different part of the brain.  The First Blessing, he said, was for housework; the Second was for out-of-house work; the Third was for fidelity; the Fourth was for listening; the Fifth was for safety.  Her father spent a long time explaining &#8220;fidelity&#8221; to her, but the other four terms seemed perfectly clear to her.</p>
		<p>By the time Diana was in fifth grade, she understood that &#8220;safety&#8221; was a euphemism.  By the time she was in eighth, she realized that she would never hear her mother give her father the Fifth Blessing; even mentioning the topic to her parents earned her a cold look.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>If you want to see the rest, drop me a note. If you don&#8217;t&#8230; I have more where that came from, bwah-hah-hah.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Every once in a while my kids get a book about Africa from the library, and invariably, it reinforces the image of the continent as one massive wildlife preserve with the occasional village. You&#8217;d never know from these books that, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos">Lagos</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinshasa">Kinshasa</a> are among the largest cities in the world.</p>

	<p>Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani, born and raised in Nigeria, the daughter of an accountant and a teacher, apparently had a similar problem. In <a href="http://www.african-writing.com/seven/adaobinwaubani.htm">this interview</a>, she says:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Most of [the books I read as a child] were about African children living in mud huts and hawking oranges to pay their school fees.  I read so many of these books that I began wishing my family  also lived in a mud hut with thatched roof, and subsisted on proceeds from our yam farm.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>She went on to write <i><a href="http://www.hyperionmedianet.com/web/showpage/bookpage.aspx?program_id=3121089&type=lead">I Do Not Come To You By Chance</a></i>, a novel about urban, internationally connected, 21st-century Nigeria. My children are about ten years too young to appreciate it, but you, Gentle Reader, are not.</p>

	<p>The novel describes the coming-of-age of Kingsley Ibe, whose college-educated parents raised him to believe that hard work and a good education are his tickets to success and respectability. Except&#8230; in spite of his college degree and his excellent grades, Kingsley remains unemployed. As his family&#8217;s financial situation grows more desperate, his only source of help is his uncle, a high-school dropout who has become fantastically wealthy running <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_fraud">419 scams</a>. Hijinks, as they say, ensue.</p>

	<p>The novel hits almost all the right notes: the characters are engaging, the plot moves right along, and it is intriguing to see the whole world of Internet scams from the other side. The only place I lost suspension of disbelief is in a brief scene where Kingsley meets an old classmate who works in the United States, and rattles off the degrees that he and his American relatives have picked up. (A master&#8217;s in &#8220;Data Transmogrification&#8221; from Yale?)</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t know if this is the author&#8217;s intention, but I can&#8217;t help reading the novel as a commentary on itself. Given the asides that explain Ibo culture and Nigerian politics, Nwaubani appears to have written the book deliberately for a foreign audience. Unlike the 419 scammers, she gives us honest value for our money. But like them, she can prosper by presenting a certain image of her country to people much wealthier than her compatriots. So when her depiction of Nigeria rings true, is it because her depiction <em>is</em> true? Or is it because she tells me what I want to believe? I&#8217;m betting on &#8220;is true&#8221;, because judging from the interview I linked to above, people in a position to know what Nigeria is really like don&#8217;t see anything amiss in the novel. And if Nwaubani <em>had</em> wanted to use her literary talents to make a dishonest buck, she could have been a kick-ass 419 scammer.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Living in Israel for eight months, even as a student in an almost-entirely English-speaking environment, made me feel very American.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn15494174894c314a76a8c2c">1</a></sup> One of the features of Israeli political culture that caught my eye was that in Israel, the state serves to allocate privileges and duties among groups, and not just among individuals.</p>

	<p>The Israeli educational system illustrates the phenomenon. There are not only separate public school systems for Jews and Arabs, but separate systems for secular and Orthodox Jews. Haredi families who consider the state religious schools to be too left-wing can send their children to schools in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinuch_Atzmai">Chinuch Atzmai</a> system, which is not run by the Ministry of Education but receives heavy subsidies from the state.</p>

	<p>Israel is a peculiar country, especially when it comes to religion/state relationships, but when it comes to state-sponsored religious education, among developed Western<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn6480101424c314a76aaf64">2</a></sup> nations, the United States is the real outlier. In Germany, Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish religious education is provided through the public schools at state expense. In Great Britain, daily worship is mandatory (although, <a href="http://www.vexen.co.uk/religion/religious_education.html">apparently</a>, it is often pro-forma) and religious education is part of the standard syllabus; furthermore, parents may send their children to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_school">faith schools</a> that are run by religious bodies, funded by local governments, and regulated by the national government. In some Canadian provinces, Catholics or Protestants can form <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separate_school">parallel school systems</a> in areas where they are religious minorities, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Canada#Religious_schools">other systems</a> for subsidizing religious education exist, depending on the province. Turkey has vocational high schools that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0mam_Hatip_school">train students to become state-employed imams</a>.</p>

	<p>The Religious Right in America hopes some day to reverse Supreme Court decisions that shut down religious observance in the public schools, but as far as I can tell, they do <em>not</em> hope to reproduce the Israeli or German system in America: that is, they do not want a multi-confessional school district to set up separate classes or parallel school systems for Baptists, Pentecostalists, and Catholics. They simply want school boards to have the same constitutional power to establish a school-prayer text as they currently have to schedule football games. In recent years, some conservatives and libertarians have taken a different approach, advocating for school vouchers. But here, the emphasis is on empowering individual families to choose a school for their children, not on empowering religious bodies to establish schools where those children might attend.</p>

	<p>The American separation of church and state can also be contrasted with the French practice of <i>laïcité</i>, where friction with the Catholic Church over administration of churches led to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briand-Ceretti_Agreement">entangling the French government in the process for nominating bishops</a>, and where anxiety over overt expressions of Islam led to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_law_on_secularity_and_conspicuous_religious_symbols_in_schools">a ban on wearing conspicuous religious symbols in the public schools</a>. If such laws were passed in the United States, liberal organizations like the <span class="caps">ACLU</span> would fight them as vigorously as they fought against mandatory school prayer.</p>

	<p>In both liberal and conservative visions of the US Constitution, there is no recognition of religious communities as entities <em>apart from</em> voluntary associations of religious people. An American is free to profess the Catholic faith, pray according to Catholic traditions, and join with other Catholics to incorporate churches, schools, and so forth. Catholic voters and legislators may use their influence to move public policy in a direction closer to their religious beliefs, to the extent that the Constitution permits. But Catholicism <em>as such</em> is no concern of the state.</p>

	<p>Our human relationships are defined by more than just citizenship; our religious affiliations are not just associations we have chosen, but reflect powerful feelings of identity. But American political activists who agree on little else share a disinterest in elevating those identities to legal personhood. The individual is both the object and subject of the law.</p>

	<p>In other words: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn15494174894c314a76a8c2c"><sup>1</sup> Or, as one might say in Spanish, <i>muy estadounidense</i>.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn6480101424c314a76aaf64"><sup>2</sup> As far as I can tell from Googling, Japan and South Korea do not have any kind of sectarian religious instruction in their public schools, nor do their governments sponsor religious schools.</p>]]>

		<p>The Instinctive Drowning Response&#8230; does not look like most people expect.  There is very little splashing, no waving, and no yelling or calls for help of any kind.  To get an idea of just how quiet and undramatic from the surface drowning can be, consider this:  It is the number two cause of accidental death in children, age 15 and under (just behind vehicle accidents) – of the approximately 750 children who will drown next year, about 375 of them will do so within 25 yards of a parent or other adult.  <strong>In ten percent of those drownings, the adult will actually watch them do it, having no idea it is happening.</strong></p>

<![CDATA[<p>The Seven-Year-Old had been spooked by a book he had been reading in his bed, and I was looking for something to distract him from his fears.  I picked up Sally Miller Gerhart&#8217;s <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KpgcAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=wanderground">Wanderground</a>, flipped through it, and then thought better of offering it to him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;This probably isn&#8217;t a book for seven-year-olds,&#8221; I said, recalling that although the world the book portrays is bucolic, some of the stories within are less so. &#8220;It&#8217;s a book about a bunch of women who live without any men.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The child, who had seen the map in the frontispiece, asked, &#8220;Is &#8216;Dangerland&#8217; where all the men live?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;How did you figure that out?&#8221;</p>

	<p>(I <em>do</em> actually recommend <i>Wanderground</i>&#8230; to grown-ups. For the purpose of this book, puberty is probably a necessary condition of grown-up-hood, but not a sufficient one.)</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>After a long long hiatus, I am using some of my Copious Free Time for writing science fiction. Not wanting to repeat the mistakes that I saw in a certain Internet imbroglio last year, I am also trying to give myself a better multicultural education, and one of the first books that came to hand was called, natch, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DN9ZAAAAMAAJ&q=greywolf+annual+multi-cultural+literacy&dq=greywolf+annual+multi-cultural+literacy&hl=en&ei=U4rwS8G4CYL48Ab83eT9Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBg"><i>Multi-Cultural Literacy</i></a>. In one essay from that book—&#8220;Tlilli, Tlapalli: The Path of the Red and Black Ink&#8221;, by Gloria Anzaldúa—there is this passage:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>When I create stories in my head, that is, allow the voices and scenes to be projected in the inner screen of my mind, I &#8220;trance.&#8221; I used to think I was going crazy or that I was having hallucinations. But now I realize it is my job, my calling, to traffic in images. Some of these film-like narratives I write down; most are lost, forgotten. When I don&#8217;t write the images down for several days or weeks or months, I get physically ill&#8230;.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>I believe this is the sensation that, in the fanfic community, is known as &#8220;plotbunnies&#8221;.</p>]]>

	<p>If we the infidels of the United States were <em>actually</em> groaning under the heel of an Islamist dictatorship, a government that dealt out harsh punishments to those it perceived as enemies of the faith, it would make sense for us, as a protest, to organize an <a href="http://www.mynorthwest.com/?nid=11&amp;sid=313170">Everybody Draw Mohammed Day</a>. Defy the regime! Fill the jails! Fight the power!</p>

	<p>If America swarmed with jihadists who, in spite of the best efforts of the police, could execute some random sample of those who offended their religion, then an Everybody Draw Mohammed day would do nothing to stop them from killing again; it would just give them a broader selection of targets to choose from. The proper response to such a terrorist campaign would not be more drawings, but more criminal indictments against the terrorists.</p>

	<p>Here in the real America, about five years ago, we already had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy">a controversy over cartoons depicting Mohammed</a>, and despite much hand-wringing from American newspaper editors (including, to their great discredit, the editors of the <em>Boston Phoenix</em>) along the lines of &#8220;<span class="caps">OMG</span> we&#8217;re afraid to publish these&#8221;, those who did publish the pictures did not suffer terrorist retaliation; the publishers were <a href="http://thephoenix.com/BLOGS/bigblogoncampus/archive/2006/02/17/editor-suspended-over-cartoons.aspx">college newspapers at the University of Illinois and Dartmouth</a>, not exactly hard targets. Here in the real America, within the past six months, we have seen one would-be terrorist set his underwear on fire and one who didn&#8217;t know how to construct a car bomb that actually exploded. I would be a lot more frightened of al-Qaeda if their Department of Exploding Human Resources could recruit some higher-quality terrorists.</p>

	<p>If your Muse inspires you to draw a picture of the founder of Islam, your right to do so is fully protected by the First Amendment, and anyone who retaliates against your art with threats of violence should be prosecuted. But this campaign to <i>épater les imams</i> is not a bold strike against the forces of intolerance. At best, it&#8217;s wanking; at worst, it&#8217;s a rallying point for bigotry.</p>

	<p>If you as a civilian are inspired to put your life on the line to defend the United States Constitution against terrorism, please consider, instead, volunteering to be an escort at an abortion clinic.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>My wife called me at work this morning to report that she hadn&#8217;t gotten any email, not even in her might-be-spam folder. &#8220;I&#8217;ll fix it&#8221;, I said, remembering some odd &#8220;temporary failure in name resolution&#8221; messages I had received from some scripts running on the server (the virtual machine which serves this here site, and which also handles mail to ropine.com) the previous day.  So I restarted the network on the server and figured that would be the end of it.</p>

	<p>(It&#8217;s always dangerous when you <em>think you know what caused your problem</em>, and therefore focus all your attention on <em>what you think is the cause</em>, rather than the actual problem.)</p>

	<p>Tonight, when I got home, she said she <em>still</em> hadn&#8217;t gotten any mail, and I looked at the situation again, and discovered that <a href="http://www.exim.org/">my mail server</a> was not listening to the rest of the world. I&#8217;m not sure why it decided to take an unscheduled vacation&#8212;I assume this all has something to do with an unfortunate incident yesterday where I filled up my hard drive&#8212;but I brought it back up, and one of the nice things about ubiquity of spam is that it&#8217;s really easy to tell when your mail service is working.</p>

	<p>I must admit that every time this happens I wonder whether running my very own mail server on a machine (albeit virtual) that I administer by my very own self demonstrates more geek-machismo than practical sense. However, for the time being, I am too lazy to migrate to doing it any other way.</p>

	<p>Mail servers that are properly configured, i.e., those not used for sending spam, should just keep trying to send their messages for about five days before giving up, so if you sent us something today, you shouldn&#8217;t have to do anything else to make sure we get it.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Back during the reign of George the Younger, when public opinion on the war in Iraq began to sour, defenders of the administration would insist that really, we could coerce Iraq (not to mention Afghanistan and Iran) into becoming a peaceful and harmonious and pro-American democracy, if we only <em>tried harder</em>, and shame on those dirty hippies for sapping America’s mighty will. Matthew Yglesias lampooned this attitude by calling it <a href="http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2006/07/10/the_green_lantern_theory_of_ge/">the Green Lantern Theory of Geopolitics</a>.</p>

	<p>We lefties, members of the reality-based community, enlightened souls full of respect and compassion for other cultures, would never fall for this kind of sloppy thinking, right?</p>

	<p>Comrades, I give you environmentally conscious movie director <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/18/avatar-james-cameron-brazil-dam">James Cameron</a>, commenting on Brazil’s controversial Belo Monte dam project:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>I felt like I was 130 years back in time watching what the Lakota Sioux might have been saying at a point when they were being pushed and they were being killed and they were being asked to displace and they were being given some form of compensation. This was a driving force for me in the writing of <i>Avatar</i> – I couldn&#8217;t help but think that if they [the Lakota Sioux] had had a time-window and they could see the future… and they could see their kids committing suicide at the highest suicide rates in the nation… because they were hopeless and they were a dead-end society – which is what is happening now – they would have fought a lot harder.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Like Orwell’s &#8220;Big Brother&#8221; and &#8220;Newspeak&#8221;, Yglesias&#8217;s &#8220;Green Lantern Theory of Geopolitics&#8221; will probably outlast this decade’s political passions, because it describes a fallacy more deeply embedded in our culture than any one party’s platform. Unfortunately.</p>

	<p>In the meantime, I encourage Americans who regard the Lakota Sioux as human beings who aspire to prosper with their community, rather than as hopeless children of a dead-end society, to donate to the <a href="http://www.collegefund.org/">Native American College Fund</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I dare say <a href="http://calearth.org/building-designs/what-is-superadobe.html">this</a> is one of the most significant innovations in construction since the geodesic dome.</p>

	<p>As you may already know, rock, brick, concrete, and similar materials are strong under compression but weak under tension; metal, by contrast, is strong under tension but weak under compression.  Thus, in a building whose structural walls are made of concrete, metal rebar might be used to provide tensile strength.</p>

	<p>Nader Khalili <a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5934027.html">patented</a> a building system that works along similar lines, but instead of concrete, he used sandbags, and instead of rebar, he used <em>barbed wire</em>. You presumably can&#8217;t build a skyscraper with these materials, but by arranging them in domes and then plastering them over, a team of semi-skilled workers can make single-story buildings&#8212;<a href="http://calearth.org/building-designs/emergency-sandbag-shelter.html">small</a>, <a href="http://calearth.org/building-designs/eco-dome.html">medium</a>, or <a href="http://calearth.org/building-designs/earth-one.html">large</a>&#8212;that meet California&#8217;s standards for earthquake safety.</p>

	<p>I would kvell to learn how to make a house like this, but it looks like the only place that teaches the technique is in California, and the alumni are either themselves in California or have moved even farther afield.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I hear that some politicians south of the Mason-Dixon line have proclaimed April to be “Confederate History Month”. The most eloquent commentary I have read on this subject comes from <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/04/the-ghost-of-bobby-lee/38813/">Ta-Nehisi Coates</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>The Lost Cause is necromancy&#8212;it summons the dead and enslaves them to the need of their vainglorious, self-styled descendants. Its greatest crime is how it denies, even in death, the humanity of the very people it claims to venerate. This isn&#8217;t about &#8220;honoring&#8221; the past&#8212;it&#8217;s about an inability to cope with the present.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>As a bonus, for the benefit of those who are too sophisticated to believe that the Civil War was primarily a war over slavery, Coates provides choice excerpts from various states’ declarations of secession. Read, as they say, the rest.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Like most of my co-workers, I have long expected that my happy little GeoStartup would some day be acquired by a much larger company—the <span class="caps">IPO</span> market being kind of <i>shvakh</i> these days—but I was surprised to learn <em>which</em> company ended up acquiring us. After having some time to reflect, though, I can appreciate what a far-sighted decision that was. A corporate group that purchases its raw materials in 55 different countries, manufactures its products in 10, distributes them from 16, and offers retail outlets in 25; a group with over a hundred thousand employees and over 20 billion euros in annual sales; a brand known worldwide for low prices, quality manufacturing, and social conscience; one that continually strives to improve itself—surely such a corporate colossus can find new and innovative uses for a cutting-edge Geographic Search and Reference Platform.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Recently, there was a dust-up between Amazon, an information technology colossus that happens to sell books, and Macmillan, one of the six conglomerates behind just about every book published in the United States. Amazon wanted to price all of its Kindle e-books at $9.99 or less; Macmillan, not wanting e-books to undercut its sales of paper books, wanted a deal where they set the retail price and guaranteed Amazon a fixed proportion of the take. As negotiations bogged down, Amazon, no doubt wanting to Send A Message, decided to remove all Macmillan books from its catalog—not just the e-books, but the paper editions as well. At which point authors and fans whose books had been delisted Sent Their Own Message, along the lines of, <em>Amazon, You Suck</em>. So Amazon caved, and now Macmillan is free to offer $14.99 e-books to the masses.</p>

	<p>Some people may wonder: why on earth should anyone pay fifteen bucks for a stack of bits that cost nigh-unto-zero to reproduce? In response to this argument, Tobias Buckell <a href="http://www.tobiasbuckell.com/2010/01/31/why-my-books-are-no-longer-for-sale-via-amazon/">walked his readers through what it costs to publish a book</a>, pointing out that even before you consider the cost of paper and ink and shipping, the editors and artists and proofreaders have to get paid. <a href="http://scottwesterfeld.com/blog/2010/02/zinc-blinked/">According to Scott Westerfeld</a>, the cost of printing a book is between three and ten percent of list price.</p>

	<p>I’m not going to argue with Real Authors (especially authors whose books I like) about the economics of the publishing industry, but I beg to point out that in the free market, prices are set by supply <em>and demand</em>. As a representative of the &#8220;demand&#8221; side, I think something is seriously amiss here.</p>

	<p>I can&#8217;t stand to read long documents on an <span class="caps">LCD</span> screen, so if I&#8217;m ever going to take the e-book plunge, either laptop screens need to improve significantly, or I&#8217;m going to get an E-Ink-based reader. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reading-Display-Generation/dp/B0015T963C/ref=amb_link_40369842_2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-1&amp;pf_rd_r=050N0RWGEQHYPHVM4DP5&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=897491022&amp;pf_rd_i=507846">Amazon Kindle</a> and the <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nook/index.asp?cds2Pid=30919">B&amp;N Nook</a> both retail for $259.00. According to the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cex/csxstnd.htm">Consumer Expenditure Survey</a> for 2008, that&#8217;s double what the average American spends on reading <em>in a year</em>. In exchange for that $259.00, I would have free access to a whole pile of out-of-copyright and freely licensed documents in e-book form, but since I&#8217;m not reading those works <em>now</em>, I don&#8217;t consider that access to be worth anything to me. What about all those e-books that I can <em>buy</em>?</p>

	<p>I checked out <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/">Charles Stross&#8217;s</a> titles on both Amazon and B&amp;N. When a Stross title is available as a mass-market paperback, the paperback almost always lists for $7.99 (B&amp;N currently is having a &#8220;everyone gets the member rate&#8221; sale, so they are actually offering them at $7.19) and the Kindle or Nook edition almost always costs $6.39. Buckell&#8217;s <i>Crystal Rain</i> and <i>Ragamuffin</i> are available for $7.99 in <em>either</em> mass-market paperback or Kindle form. The books in Westerfeld&#8217;s <i>Uglies</i> tetrology are either $8.99 or $9.99 in paperback, depending on the title; the discount on the e-book version ranges from $1.00 to $5.77 (the latter is for the Kindle version of <i>Extras</i>, the most recent book in the series; I assume that&#8217;s a promotional rate).</p>

	<p>Let&#8217;s generously assume, based on the numbers in this survey, that the e-book versions of the titles I would want to buy will sell for, on average, a $2.00 discount off their paperback prices. At that rate, I&#8217;d have to buy 130 e-books before I recoup the cost of the reader itself. And who knows how many times e-book pricing and technology are going to change before I buy another 130 books?</p>

	<p>Wait a minute. Did I say it cost $259.00 for <em>an</em> e-book reader? But of course, I want to be able to share my books with my wife, and sometimes we both might want to read different books at the same time. So our household would need to get <em>two</em> readers, the cost of which might be recovered after buying <em>259</em> books.</p>

	<p>And on top of that, the <em>value</em> to me of an e-book is less than that of a paper book, because with the Digital Rights Management built into the technology, I can&#8217;t loan my e-book to a friend (unless I bought it from B&amp;N and the title has &#8220;LendMe&trade;&#8221; enabled <em>as a special feature</em>), sell it to a used book store, or donate it to a library.</p>

	<p>Obviously there are a few people out there who find enough other value in e-books to make them worth the money. (Best-sellers seem to have very steeply discounted e-book editions, so if you&#8217;re the sort of person who likes to read a lot of best-sellers as soon as they come out, e-books may be a reasonable choice for you.) Hopefully their dollars will sustain the industry until it can come up with a business model that makes sense to the rest of us. And perhaps there are others who <em>thought</em> the cutting-edge technology they bought was a wise investment, and are now fuming about how their hopes have been dashed, their expectations frustrated. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga#Amiga_community">All of this has happened before, and it all will happen again.</a></p>

	<p>In the meantime, paper books are serving me well, so I&#8217;ll keep buying them.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Every once in a while my wife asks me, &#8220;So what <em>is</em> in this health-care reform bill, anyway, and what good will it do us?&#8221; And I usually answer something like &#8220;a hummina hummina hummina&#8221;, because with all the negotiations and plans and bills and amendments and proposals that have been floated for the past nine months, it&#8217;s hard to keep track. Fortunately, Igor Volsky, of the Center for American Progress&#8217;s &#8220;Wonk Room&#8221; blog, has compiled <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2010/02/22/obama-health-plan/">a handy table</a> showing the salient differences between the bill passed by the House, the bill passed by the Senate, and the compromise that the White House has proposed today.</p>

	<p>The common points, briefly, are:
	<ul>
		<li>Everybody except the very lowest-income families, or people whose premiums would be more than a certain percentage of their income, must buy insurance.</li>
		<li>Most employers will be pressured to provide insurance to their employees, but the exemption for small employers and the exact form of pressure varies among the bills.</li>
		<li>Lower-income households would get subsidies to help them pay their premiums.</li>

<![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve seen a lot of angst in the Jewish blogosphere over the ever-rising cost of day school tuition; <a href="http://forward.com/articles/123854/">this article</a>, linked by someone on my LJ-friends list, is the latest example of the genre. The problem has a tragic dimension, because of a little-known wrinkle in economics called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease">Baumol effect</a>.</p>

	<p>James Surowiecki <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/07/07/030707ta_talk_surowiecki">explains</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>When Mozart composed his String Quintet in G Minor (K. 516), in 1787, you needed five people to perform it—two violinists, two violists, and a cellist. Today, you still need five people, and, unless they play really fast, they take about as long to perform it as musicians did two centuries ago. So much for progress.</p>
		<p>An economist would say that the productivity of classical musicians has not improved over time, and in this regard the musicians aren’t alone. In a number of industries, workers produce about as much per hour as they did a decade or two ago&#8230;.</p>
		<p>The rest of the American economy functions differently. In most businesses, workers are continually getting more productive and can produce a lot more per hour than they could ten or twenty years ago. In 1979, workers at G.M. needed forty-one hours to assemble a car. Today, they need just twenty-four&#8230;. Because companies are producing more for less, they can hold down costs, and when times are good they can raise wages without hiking prices. So, in the late nineties, as productivity rose, wages did, too, though inflation lay dormant.</p>
		<p>Generally, productivity growth is a boon, but it creates problems for non-productive enterprises like classical music, education, and car repair: to keep luring talent, they have to increase wages, or else people eventually migrate to businesses that pay better. Instead of becoming nurses or mechanics, they become telecom engineers or machinists. That’s why teachers are getting paid a lot more than they were twenty years ago. (The average salary for an associate college professor has risen almost seventy per cent since the early eighties, and that’s if you adjust for inflation.) To pay those wages, schools and hospitals have to raise prices. The result is that in industries where productivity is flat costs and prices keep going up.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>So if we want to keep Jewish education accessible, instead of letting it consume an ever-increasing proportion of each family’s income, we have to think about ways to make it more <em>productive</em>. How could our community achieve at least some of the goals of Jewish day school <em>without</em> hiring one full-time teacher for every fifteen to twenty-five children?</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ll offer one idea: A team that knows something about Judaism and programming could set up a Jewish-themed online role-playing environment, where Jewish kids from all across the country, whether or not in day school, could meet like-minded folks, socialize, and take lessons in Jewish religion and culture in the form of quests for honor and treasure. We could call it &#8220;World of Frumkeit&#8221;.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Democrats in the House are now trying to decide what their next step should be with regard to health care reform. <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/01/tally-sheet-where-house-dems-stand-on-how-to-move-health-care-reform-forward.php?ref=fpa">The main options under discussion</a> seem to be:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Hold their noses, pass the Senate’s bill, and move on to the next agenda item. (This would require liberal Democrats to hold their noses very, very tightly.)</li>
		<li>Pass the Senate’s bill and then pass a separate bill, through the budget-reconciliation process, that fixes the parts that the House finds most obnoxious. (This would require some assurance from Senate Democrats that they’d actually take action on the separate bill. Such assurance is not currently forthcoming.)</li>
		<li>Break health care reform into several smaller bills and pass those bills separately. (Each of those bills would then have to go to the Senate, which would have to pass a motion to introduce the bill, a motion to end debate on the bill, and a motion to end debate on putting the bill to a final vote; each of those motions could be filibustered and even if they got 60 votes for cloture, Senate rules allow 30 hours of debate on each motion. The people who are proposing this route either have a truly cunning plan or are <strong>on crack</strong>.)</li>
		<li><strong>&eta;</strong> Pass <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/health/policy/22health.html?hp">a bill that’s even weaker than what the House and Senate have passed</a> in the hope that at least one Republican can be persuaded to vote for cloture on it. <strong>(<span class="caps">AAARRGHH</span>!)</strong></li>
	</ul>

	<p>The longer they dither about this, the worse the party looks and the greater the chance that everyone will just walk away from the issue and hope the Republicans don’t make mincemeat out of them in the fall. I would say that the need to take <em>some</em> action, on both political and policy grounds, is so blindingly obvious that a rational politician shouldn’t need encouragement, but—sigh—we’re dealing with Democrats here. I would say that politicans who are so committed to acting like losers don’t deserve to win elections, but even if they deserve that consequence, the country doesn’t.</p>

	<p>So if you vote in the United States and your district is represented by a Democrat in the House, please <strong>call your Representative today</strong> and let him or her know where you stand. The House switchboard is (202)&nbsp;224-3121.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I spent today volunteering for the Coakley campaign, helping it try and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat (after the Democratic Party spent a month going “jaws of defeat? what jaws of defeat? we can’t possibly lose!”—but every other liberal blog in the country has <em>that</em> rant). I told the Organizing for America coordinator that I was interested in canvassing, but not in making phone calls, because enough of my friends, not to mention my wife, had been complaining about the incessant phone calls. (What with the mayoral election in November, the special-Senate-election primary in December, and the election itself today, it has been <em>the season</em> for everybody and his brother to leave us a message explaining how So-and-So is the greatest politician since Pericles and could you please remember to vote on Tuesday.)</p>

	<p>And hanging out at the office (of a union local that was participating in the campaign), waiting for the van to come pick up us canvassers, I talked to some of the other volunteers and some of the office staff, and they too were kinda sick of all the phone calls. And this was one of the offices <em>from which people were making phone calls</em> on behalf of the candidate. Seeing the instructions for those folks, I could imagine what kind of technology they were using on the back end; it’s sort of cool. A good <a href="http://www.asterisk.org/">Asterisk</a> hacker could probably build it in a month or so.</p>

	<p>The procedure for participating in the vote-for-Coakley phone bank went something like this:
	<ol>
		<li>Call a certain toll-free number and type in your ID number on the telephone keypad.</li>
		<li>Listen to a tutorial on how the system works.</li>
		<li>When you hear a beep, it means you are connected to a real live person and not an answering machine.  Say “hello” and go right into your vote-for-Coakley script.</li>
		<li>When the call is finished, <em>do not hang up</em>. Instead, press the star key.</li>
		<li>Then type in a code indicating the kind of response you got. (I don’t remember the numbers, but it was something like 1 for “hang up”, 2 for “I already voted”, 3 for “I haven’t voted but I will”&#8230; you get the idea.)</li>
		<li>You will automatically be connected to the next voter; go back to step 3.</li>
	</ol></p>

	<p>So if you were, say, a college student in California who wanted to do something for the Massachusetts Senate race (on either side—I assume the Republicans have a similar system), but you had no money to donate, you couldn’t fly out to Massachusetts, and indeed you only had the occasional half-hour between classes&#8230; no problem! The party could give you their phone bank’s toll-free number, give you an ID number, and you could do your part to grease the wheels of democracy. And with this technology, a small staff could manage to get useful work out of hundreds (thousands?) of untrained passionate volunteers all over the country. <em>Isn’t that great?</em></p>

	<p>Maybe not.</p>

	<p>By making each voter telephone contact so cheap <em>for the caller</em>, even as the irritation level <em>for the callee</em> has stayed constant, the whole enterprise of phone-banking is starting to resemble spam. The only difference is that when you get spam in your mailbox advertising organic penile-enhancement products, you don’t really know who sent it, so you delete it (or send it to your spam filter’s tuning system) and get on with your life. If you get spammed over the phone in the name of some political candidate, you remember that candidate’s name, and not necessarily favorably.</p>

	<p>In preparation for next fall’s Congressional elections, party committees would do themselves a big favor by deciding how many times they really needed to contact each voter by phone, setting themselves a limit, <em>and publically pledging not to go over that limit</em>. In some districts, this sort of discipline might force them to turn away volunteers—telling them “if all you can do for us is make phone calls, sorry, we already have enough people to reach everyone we need and we don’t want to overdo it”. It might be hard to turn down free labor, but this is a freebie that comes with a hidden cost.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Recently, Rabbi Arthur Waskow, a leader in the Jewish Renewal movement, <a href="http://www.theshalomcenter.org/node/1672">encouraged</a> “fellow-seekers for peace and healing of the earth” to see <a href="http://www.avatarmovie.com/"><i>Avatar</i></a>, James Cameron’s film about native resistance to a resource-extraction conglomerate, and to connect that film with the upcoming Jewish holiday of Tu B&#8217;Shevat.</p>

	<p>In the same vein, I encourage my environmentally conscious readers to go out and see <a href="http://www.daybreakersmovie.com/"><i>Daybreakers</i></a>, this year&#8217;s big-budget movie about vampires who combust rather than sparkle.</p>

	<p><i>Daybreakers</i> is set in a future where nearly every human being on earth has become a vampire, but now a blood shortage is putting their eternal lives at stake. Just like overfishing has ruined the stock of North Atlantic cod, ten years of growth in the vampire population has reduced the human population to a minute fraction of its former glory, and even with advanced technology sustaining humans in blood-farms, there is not enough left to slake the planet&#8217;s thirst. The main character, a hematologist for a sinister vampiric megacorporation, is trying to synthesize artificial blood that can mitigate the need for human stock, but as his experiments result in failure after failure, bloodlust-driven civil unrest becomes more and more of a threat.</p>

	<p>One might ask: how on earth did these vampires let the situation get so far out of hand? Couldn&#8217;t they have, for example, ensured that a healthy breeding population of humans was kept alive in some kind of nature reserve? But of course, future generations will probably ask similar questions about our own environmental catastrophes, in which our own short-term hunger is blinding us to the long-term needs of our planet. The vampires of <i>Daybreakers</i>, thus, reflect our own selfish desires back to us, and the movie teaches us a valuable ecological lesson: manage your stocks of edible wildlife, or they will manage you.</p>

	<p>PS: Speaking of blood-sucking: <em>eleven dollars</em> for a movie ticket?!</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Over the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve seen some <a href="http://io9.com/5422666/when-will-white-people-stop-making-movies-like-avatar">controversy</a> in political and SF blogs regarding a certain Hollywood movie, in which a white American human takes on the form of a blue-skinned alien. I was reminded of this when I read last week&#8217;s parsha (Exodus 1:1–6:1), because one could argue that the young Moses is an Egyptian prince who has the form of an Israelite. Pharoah&#8217;s daughter describes him as &#8220;from the Hebrew children&#8221; in 2:7, and Jethro&#8217;s daughters describe him as &#8220;an Egyptian man&#8221; in 2:19. This dual identity gives us a new way to understand one of the most cryptic passages in the Torah, Exodus 4:24–26, which the new <span class="caps">JPS</span> version tentatively renders as follows:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>At a night encampment on the way, the <span class="caps">LORD</span> encountered him and sought to kill him. So Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son&#8217;s foreskin, and touched his legs with it, saying: &#8220;You are truly a bridegroom of blood to me!&#8221; And when He let him alone, she added, &#8220;A bridegroom of blood because of the circumcision.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Moses is on his way back to Egypt, to deliver his first &#8220;let my people go&#8221; message to Pharoah. And <em>now</em> God wants to kill him?  What&#8217;s going on here?  Rashi cites a midrash that Moses was condemned for not circumcising his son, but this explanation raises problems of its own. Given that Moses could have argued that circumcising an infant before taking him on an arduous journey is dangerous, and given that failure to circumcise promptly is not a capital offense in halakha, why did God suddenly judge Moses so harshly? Better scholars than myself have put forth a variety of answers to this question, but I&#8217;d like to put forward my own.</p>

	<p>Let&#8217;s back up to 4:18, when Moses tells his father-in-law, &#8220;Please let me go and return to my brothers in Egypt, and see if they are still alive.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;my brothers in Egypt&#8221; is ambiguous; maybe even <em>strategically</em> ambiguous. Does he mean his Hebrew blood relatives, who are being worked to death as slaves? Or does he mean his adoptive Egyptian family, which might have suffered a purge when the new pharoah (2:23) took power?</p>

	<p>After Moses takes up wife, children, donkey, and staff, God reviews his mission, but adds a detail (4:22–23) that He had not previously mentioned:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Say to Pharoah: &#8220;This is what the Eternal says: Israel is My first-born son. I am saying to you, &#8216;send my son so he can serve Me&#8217;, and if you refuse to send him, behold, I will execute your first-born son.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>I submit that this message <em>is a veiled threat against Moses himself.</em> God is asking: do you consider yourself a member of the nation that is My first-born son, or are you the first-born son of Pharoah&#8217;s daughter? Whose side are you on?</p>]]>

Girls who devoured these books during the 1980s and 1990s now have children of their own and, as one bookseller put it, the rebooted series would sell “really well to the girls who aren’t quite ready for vampires and particularly to the parents of the girls who aren’t quite ready.”</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Like most liberals, I’m disappointed by all the compromises that the Democrats had to make to get their 60th Senate vote<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn21407600414b341c39a87e7">1</a></sup> for health care reform. But make no mistake: even without single-payer, public option, or Medicare buy-in, this law is A Very Good Thing.  <a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2009/12/healthcares-penultimage-hurdle">Kevin Drum summarizes</a> what we are getting:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>
	<ul>
		<li> Insurers have to take all comers.  They can&#8217;t turn you down for a preexisting condition or cut you off after you get sick.</li>
		<li>Community rating.  Within a few broad classes, everyone gets charged the same amount for insurance.</li>
		<li>Individual mandate.  (Remember how we all argued that this was a progressive feature back when John Edwards and Hillary Clinton were championing it during the primaries?)</li>
		<li>A significant expansion of Medicaid.</li>
		<li>Subsidies for low and middle income workers that keeps premium costs under 10% of income.</li>
		<li>Limits on ER charges to low-income uninsured emergency patients.</li>
		<li>Caps on out-of-pocket expenses.</li>
		<li>A broad range of cost-containment measures.</li>
		<li>A dedicated revenue stream to support all this.</li>
	</ul></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The chief objection to the bill, among left-wingers who would rather blow the whole thing up than pass it, is that by requiring everyone to buy insurance and not having any publically sponsored competition to keep prices down, the bill represents a massive giveaway to the for-profit insurance industry. On the one hand, they are absolutely right. On the other hand, letting corporate interests skim off social-welfare programs has been <em>standard operating procedure</em> in American politics for decades, even before <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/10/rnc-web-site-pays-tribute-to-ronaldus-magnus.php">Ronaldus Magnus</a>. Food stamps are a wonderful benefit to agribusiness. Federally guaranteed loans for both housing and college education are basically free money for banks. Programs like <a href="http://www.sbir.gov/"><span class="caps">SBIR</span></a> funnel government research grants to private firms with the explicit expectation that those firms will turn the research into profitable commercial products.</p>

	<p>This is all basically legalized graft, but it does give these programs stakeholders with more political clout than, say, minimum-wage workers. And I don’t see how progressives can push the political system far enough to the left that cutting deals with Big Business becomes unnecessary. To do that, a President Obama wouldn&#8217;t be influential enough; we&#8217;d need a President Lenin.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn21407600414b341c39a87e7"><sup>1</sup> They passed up a golden opportunity during the Bush years. When Republicans were clamoring for an “up-or-down vote” to get Bush’s Supreme Court nominees in, the Democrats should have doubled down and said, “let’s eliminate the filibuster for <em>everything</em>”.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I generally have a “meh” attitude towards nuclear power. I’m not one of those folks who thinks that anything with the word “nuclear” in it must automatically be Evil. But as a practical matter, nuclear plants have proven so capital-intensive and so dependent on government subsidy that <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2009/0901.blake.html">their value as carbon-free power investments has been drastically oversold</a>. Nuclear-plant operators in the United States don’t have to pay the full cost of their own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price%E2%80%93Anderson_Nuclear_Industries_Indemnity_Act">liability insurance</a>. We still don’t have a permanent location for storing high-level nuclear waste, and from what I can tell, if we ever do choose such a location, taxpayers who don’t benefit directly from nuclear-generated electricity will still have to pitch in to cover the cost of disposal. If nuclear operators had to raise capital, buy liability insurance, and dispose of their waste on the open market, nobody would dare to run a nuclear power plant; if other forms of non-fossil-fuel energy enjoyed the same level of subsidy, we’d have solar panels on every roof by now (even in towns where it rains for 364 days out of the year).</p>

	<p>All of which is prelude to my fascination with <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/12/ff_new_nukes/">this news</a>: some researchers and operators are developing nuclear power plants that use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium_fuel_cycle">thorium</a>, rather than uranium, as their fuel. Thorium-232 is far more plentiful than uranium-235, the waste products don’t need to be stored for as long as the waste from a uranium-fueled reactor, and those waste products aren’t nearly as convenient for someone looking to construct a nuclear warhead.</p>

	<p>In fact, there was a lot of research into thorium-based reactors in the 1950s and 1960s. (You may recall Heinlein mentioning the element in several of his works.) So why haven’t we been using thorium-fueled reactors all along? Because back in the day, the government <em>wanted</em> nuclear power plants to produce convenient warhead material as a side effect. With the Cold War over and antiproliferation on everyone’s agenda, new priorities and new research might lead to new models for nuclear power—maybe even models that can compete fairly with renewable sources.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The “Manager’s Amendment” that gave Senator Reid his sixtieth vote for cloture on health care reform includes a new subsection, 2717(<!-- -->c), headlined “Protection of Second Amendment Gun Rights”. Agencies or activities empowered by this law may not collect information on the lawful ownership, possession, or use of firearms, and insurers may not charge higher premiums to gun owners.  (The precise text begins on page 5 of <a href="http://democrats.senate.gov/reform/managers-amendment.pdf">this <span class="caps">PDF</span> document</a>.)</p>

	<p>Presumably this was pushed into the bill as a response to <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/20/gun-owners-america/gun-rights-group-says-health-care-bill-could-harm-/">the unsubstantiated rumor</a> that health care reform was yet another facet of the Obama Administration&#8217;s sinister plan to take our guns away from our cold neuropathic hands.</p>

	<p>I should note that as far as I know, in most states, nothing prevents insurers <em>right now</em> from charging lower premiums to the unarmed. If <a href="http://www.seiu.org/2009/09/domestic-violence-victims-have-a-pre-existing-condition.php">being a victim of domestic violence can count as a pre-existing condition</a>, anything is possible, right? But my Google-fu is not strong enough to determine if anyone currently does this.</p>

	<p>So if anyone is looking to assemble a Boston Jewish Community Complaints Choir, please count me in. Bonus points if you can find a catchy tune for “everyone on my right thinks I’m a heretic and everyone on my left thinks I’m a lunatic”.</p>

Perhaps if I had been raised in a social class where &#8220;the help&#8221; was a constant presence in my life, I would not have considered this unusual, but I felt like the hosts must have been deaf to irony. What did those women say to their families when they got home from their jobs? I hope that at least they were well paid.</p>

	<p>It turns out that Maimonides, who was not raised with even the illusion of living in a classless society, had a different approach to this kind of situation. He wrote, in <i>Hilchot Chametz u-Matzah</i> 8:2:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>If [the son at the Seder] is young or of low intelligence, [the father] says to him, “My son, we all used to be slaves—like this maid, or like this slave—in Egypt, and on this night the Blessed Holy One brought us out to freedom.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Fortunately, in this millenium, other people have come up with <a href="http://blog.plover.com/kids/Tubman.html">better ways to explain slavery to the very young</a>.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn16849641234b24676dc0f82"><sup>1</sup> One of them was not, technically, a Passover Seder, but rather a birthday bash held on the first night of chol ha-mo’ed in which the hosts decided to break out the haggadot. Don’t ask.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I have certain warm fuzzy feelings&#8212;in my reptilian hindbrain, you might say&#8212;for the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_%281983_miniseries%29"><em>V</em> miniseries</a>, and I figured it would be a refreshing change to watch a new TV show <em>when it is broadcast</em> instead of waiting a few years for the <span class="caps">DVD</span>s to arrive.  So I saw the first episode of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_%282009_TV_series%29">the remake</a>.</p>

	<p>Micro-mini-review: Meh.</p>

	<p>Slightly longer review with <strong>spoilers</strong>: If a bunch of hawt alien refugees from Obama&#8217;s Presidential campaign show up with their Cunning Plan to Take Over The World, I would subcontract out the Resistance Movement to Al-Qaeda before trusting the fifth-columnists who reveal themselves in the fifth act. Why on earth did Ryan gather a dozen potential resistance fighters, including at least two whom nobody could vouch for, in one place, where they could hear his infodump and then conveniently be slaughtered? If this guy really cares about saving the planet, why didn&#8217;t he spend a few minutes in the library and learn how to set up a proper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clandestine_cell_system">cell structure</a> for passing along the same information? And did that <span class="caps">FBI</span> agent really let a member of a suspected terrorist cell inject her with an alleged anaesthetic and cut open her skin? And doesn&#8217;t Mr. Ambitious Newscaster know how to <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2098297/">grease a source</a>? And <span class="caps">WTF</span> did Reverend Young and Skeptical mean when he declared he didn&#8217;t understand how &#8220;God and aliens could live in the same universe&#8221;?</p>

	<p>I think this show is set in a universe where the Visitors really <em>are</em> the only form of intelligent life.</p>

	<p>Also, the Visitors don&#8217;t do that cool reverb thing with their voices that they did in the original series. My reptilian hindbrain is <em>so</em> disappointed.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>The Republicans in the House of Representatives have <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1009/28808.html">invited Iran-contra conspirator Oliver North to advise them on foreign policy</a>. Colonel North&#8217;s chief foreign-policy accomplishment, as you may recall, involved a clandestine sale of arms to Iranian &#8220;moderates&#8221; in order to release American hostages being held by Hezbollah, with some of the profits being diverted to support anti-communist rebels in Nicaragua. (Haven&#8217;t the Republicans been saying that negotiating with evil-doers makes the United States look weak? In this case, the fact that Hezbollah captured new American hostages to replace the ones they released kinda supports their point&#8230;) North was convicted of lying to Congress and illegally destroying government documents, but his convictions were overturned because the witnesses may have been influenced by testimony that North gave to Congress under a grant of immunity. (Don&#8217;t Republicans usually hate it when a convicted felon gets off scot-free because of some technicality involving a violation of the criminal&#8217;s Constitutional rights?)</p>

	<p>Treating a guy like this as an authority on foreign policy is like&#8230; treating Ronald Reagan as an authority on fiscal responsibility.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Stephen Stearns, an evolutionary biologist at Yale, believes that human evolution is still happening because, after all, some couples have more children than others, thereby changing the frequency distribution of alleles in the gene pool. So he and his colleagues went over some statistics from the Framingham Heart Study (going back to 1948) and <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/10/23/0906199106.full.pdf+html">discovered a few heritable traits that were associated with higher fertility</a> [PDF]. From this, they <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/time/20091024/hl_time/08599193175700">vaulted into the pages of <em>Time</em> magazine</a> with this stunning extrapolation:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>If these trends were to continue with no cultural changes in the town for the next 10 generations, by 2409 the average Framingham woman would be 2 cm (0.8 in) shorter, 1 kg (2.2 lb.) heavier, have a healthier heart, have her first child five months earlier and enter menopause 10 months later than a woman today, the study found.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Why yes.  And if human cultures had remained static for the past four centuries, we would <em>also</em> expect that the average Framingham woman of 1609 was 2 cm taller than her 21st-century counterpart, 1 kg lighter,&#8230;</p>

	<p>I looked at the actual paper (which as of this writing is not yet behind a paywall) to see if this was dumb science or just dumb science journalism, and as far as I can tell, the fault is in the science. For instance, the authors, in their conclusions, speculate that &#8220;we might have found larger effects of evolution on the levels of sex hormones and related traits had they been measured&#8221;&#8230; as if human beings have done nothing since 1948 to <em>affect the levels of their own sex hormones</em>.</p>

	<p>The process of natural selection pushes a species toward a local maximum of fitness <em>relative to its environment</em>. (When you speak of an organism&#8217;s &#8220;fitness&#8221; in an evolutionary sense, you <em>always</em> have to speak of its fitness relative to some environment, just as if you talk about the dollar &#8220;declining&#8221; in value, that decline is always relative to some other commodity.) If the environment is changing more rapidly then the evolutionary effects that adapt an organism to it, then the evolutionary effect might as well be noise. </p>

	<p>Do these guys have an insight too subtle for me to appreciate, or are they just <em>thick</em>?</p>

	<p>One of her commenters <a href="http://rm.livejournal.com/1735276.html?thread=16330092#t16330092">wondered</a> if, now that spanking children is less common, the next generation of adults will be less likely to have a kink for being spanked.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The authors of <i>Freakonomics</i>, pimping their next book, <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/book_extracts/article6879237.ece">regale <em>Sunday Times</em> [UK] readers</a> with the heart-warming tale of Allie, a prostitute with a heart of gold and a Visa card to match. The authors mention the precautions she takes <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=7398011&amp;page=1&amp;page=1">to keep herself safe from her clients</a>, her frustration with keeping her occupation secret from her family and friends, and her realization that she had to move into a completely different career before she lost her looks. In the midst of all that, the authors declare:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>[T]he real puzzle isn’t why someone like Allie becomes a prostitute, but rather why more women don’t choose this career.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Jonathan Kulick <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/2009/10/economics/the-kind-of-girl-you-read-about-in-new-wave-magazines/">gives this the snark it richly deserves</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>I look forward to reading the entire chapter, so I can find out why more men don’t choose to become high-end gay escorts.  It has to be much easier than waiting tables or accounting or laying pipe.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>I, personally, am puzzled as to why the Freakonomists are so puzzled by the choices of non-prostitute women, but treat the johns&#8217; motivation as self-evident. The vast majority of men who hire $500-an-hour prostitutes can also afford enough therapy and what-not to become attractive to the women who seek, ahem, noncommercial romantic relationships. If they&#8217;re not getting those relationships, well, that says something about their capabilities and priorities, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

	<p>Personally, if I had to choose between waiting tables for $10 an hour and <em>pretending to love</em> creepy men for $500, I&#8217;d go for the tables.</p>]]>

	<p>And just a few days ago, in synagogues all over the world, we read <i>Bereshit</i>, which describes the first recorded instance of domestic violence. That story, according to the midrash, also involves a pet. Nachmanides (s.v. Genesis 4:13) cites Bereshit Rabbah 22:27 as explaining that the &#8220;sign&#8221; that God set for Cain&#8217;s protection was actually a dog; Cain would know that wherever the dog went, he could follow safely.</p>

	<p>OK, it&#8217;s not a perfect parallel: Cain was a perpetrator of violence, not a victim. But unlike many other perpetrators since Genesis, he repented and, as far as we know from the text, didn&#8217;t do it again&#8230;</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>The entrepreneurs who founded <a href="http://www.absolutebestcare.com/">Absolute Best Care</a> have come up with a brilliant business plan&#8212;or possibly a brilliant grift&#8212;and the <i>New York Times</i> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/13/nyregion/13bigcity.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=nanny&amp;st=cse">doesn&#8217;t understand it</a>.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8230;To that end comes the Absolute Best Care Learning Center, scheduled to open Oct. 26. For a mere $4,000 — $2,040 if you act now — aspiring nannies who attend a seven-day course will obtain training in child care, developmental milestones, <span class="caps">CPR</span>, first aid and household management. (Five have signed up so far.)</p>
		<p>It’s worth pointing out that pediatric first aid and <span class="caps">CPR</span> courses rarely run more than a few hundred bucks, and that the textbook Absolute will be using, “Mrs. Starkey’s Nanny Manager,” is $79.95 on Amazon.com.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>But as soon as I saw the price tag, I could tell that <span class="caps">ABC</span> is not selling these classes to aspiring nannies. The overprivileged parents who were portrayed in <i>The Nanny Diaries</i> will <em>send their nannies to this school</em>, and cheerfully exchange those kilobucks for the peace of mind that comes from having a properly-educated servant.</p>

	<p>The great thing about the corporate-training biz is that as long as there are employers out there with money to burn (as a tax-deductible business expense, no less), you can set prices in the stratosphere. If Harvard Extension can charge $1,975 for a six-hour class in <a href="http://www.extension.harvard.edu/2009-10/courses/21144.jsp?caller=dce">Fundamentals of Website Development</a>, then I&#8217;m sure <span class="caps">ABC</span> will have no trouble finding enough parents in the Upper West Side to fill their classes at $2,040, or even $4,000, per seat.</p>]]>

True, some other laureates (Bishop Tutu, for example) got their awards before finishing their peacemaking jobs, but in those cases one could argue that the prestige of the prize gave them credibility and influence that they needed. If <em>the president of the United States of America</em> needs that kind of boost to accomplish his mission, then our country&#8217;s international standing is even worse than I had previously imagined. And yeah, he&#8217;s Not George W. Bush, but by that standard of good behavior, three-quarters of the planet must be eligible for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Many progressives, myself included, have been concerned that (a)&nbsp;Democratic politicians are so used to losing that they will continue to act like losers on the floor of Congress, even when they are in the majority; (b)&nbsp;with war, the economy, and health care at the front of most people&#8217;s minds, Obama and the Congressional Democrats will push <span class="caps">LGBT</span> issues to the back burner until, umm, half-past never.</p>

	<p>So let me give credit where credit is due: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/us/politics/09hate.html?hp">the House passed a bill to extend Federal hate-crimes protection to gay, lesbian, bi, <em>and trans</em> people</a>, and the Democrats played hardball to get it passed&#8212;they attached the hate-crimes extension to a defense-appropriations bill and dared the Republicans to vote against the whole bill.</p>

	<p>The article quotes Senator McCain, of all people, saying that &#8220;elections have consequences&#8221;. Elections damn well <em>should</em> have consequences and this particular consequence is most welcome.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Orthodox Jews believe that the Torah is the Word of God, and one of the aims of Orthodox school systems is to teach young Jews to read that text in its original Hebrew. Even in the non-Orthodox strands of Judaism, religious education is &#8220;Hebrew school&#8221;; there is a cultural recognition that <em>the Bible</em> is that <em>Hebrew</em> book on the rabbi&#8217;s shelf.</p>

	<p>Muslims believe that the Koran is the Word of God, and one of the aims of Muslim religious schools is to teach children to read it in the original Arabic. If I recall correctly from a class I took a decade ago, Muslims in Third World countries where Arabic is not anyone&#8217;s native language try to memorize verses of the Koran in the original Arabic, even if they don&#8217;t have the time or resources to advance their Arabic literacy beyond that point.</p>

	<p>A certain stream of Protestant Christianity believes that the Christian Bible is the &#8220;literal&#8221; Word of God. Once upon a time in America&#8212;when the Puritans ruled Massachusetts with an iron fist&#8212;these Christians, too, believed that it was important for a believer to read these sacred texts in their original languages.</p>

	<p>This attitude has fallen by the wayside. I used to entertain myself by striking up conversations with Christian evangelists on street corners, and I have been amazed at how consistently <em>incurious</em> they tended to be about the original version of the text they held sacred&#8212;how <em>content</em> they were at letting Greek and Hebrew literacy be the province of some small elite who could be trusted to translate everything for the masses. Well, I keep telling myself, I shouldn&#8217;t judge Christianity by Jewish standards. It&#8217;s not like they have to live by hundreds of commandments whose precise meaning is teased out by the exegesis of individual letters of the text.</p>

	<p>Then I came across the <a href="http://conservapedia.com/Conservative_Bible_Project">Conservative Bible Project</a>, an effort by Andrew Schlafly<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn18535871224acd4a2059866">1</a></sup> to create a translation of the Bible that is free of that dreaded Liberal Bias. I personally thought that <em>being able to read a text in its original language</em> is a necessary precondition for <em>translating</em> it, but perhaps I am too blinded by my Liberal Bias to realize that such formalities are not necessary. Or perhaps Schlafly is just a blithering idiot. Observe how he is pwn3d by his betters in both <a href="http://conservapedia.com/Talk:Conservative_Bible_Project#Use_the_original_texts">Greek</a> and <a href="http://conservapedia.com/Talk:Conservative_Bible_Project#Names_of_God">Hebrew</a> literacy, and doesn&#8217;t even seem aware of it.</p>

	<p>If you are <em>not</em> a blithering idiot, then depending on your religion or lack thereof, this project is cause for <a href="http://slacktivist.typepad.com/slacktivist/2009/10/inevitable.html">sorrow</a> or <a href="http://www.sadlyno.com/archives/25741.html">snark</a>. Cheap shots aside, though, you have to wonder: once someone takes this &#8220;I&#8217;ve made up my mind and don&#8217;t bother me with the facts&#8221; attitude towards his own holy scriptures, what does this say about his trustworthiness&#8212;or his readers&#8217; credulity&#8212;on any other topic under the sun?</p>

	<p>And consider how lucky this man is to live in a country where the First and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee his freedom of religion. The Puritans would have burned this guy at the frigging <em>stake</em>.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn18535871224acd4a2059866"><sup>1</sup> Andrew Schlafly is the principal author of Conservapedia, <a href="http://newsjunkiepost.com/2009/10/07/top-50-conservative-websites-reveal-alarming-patterns/">one of the top 50 conservative Web sites</a>, and also the son of conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly. <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/08/30/royalty/index.html">Glenn Greenwald&#8217;s snark about meritocracy in America</a> is hereby incorporated, as if by restatement.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>One of my pet peeves about discussion of Israel among left-wingers is the prevalence of the idea that the Jewish state is an illegitimate entity that should be eliminated, not just compelled to yield territory to a Palestinian state. Even if we assume for the purpose of argument that every complaint about the morality of Zionism is true, it would prove that Israel as a nation-state is born in sin, as it were&#8212;and similar complaints can be made about every other nation-state on this planet. (If you say &#8220;all those other countries committed their founding war crimes long long ago, before the international community even recognized them as such,&#8221; then I will respond with one word: &#8220;Serbia&#8221;.)</p>

	<p>So I guess I have to give props to Muammar Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi, Revolutionary Leader of the Great Socialist People&#8217;s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, for his proposal to <a href="http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/news_digest/Libyan_anti_Swiss_motion_rejected.html?siteSect=104&amp;sid=11162783&amp;cKey=1252038089000&amp;ty=nd">break up Switzerland</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Gaddafi first mentioned the idea of dismemberment during the G8 summit in Italy in July. Switzerland &#8220;is a world mafia and not a state&#8221;, he said, adding that it was &#8220;formed of an Italian community that should return to Italy, another German community that should return to Germany, and a third French community that should return to France&#8221;.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Note that Gaddafi has also endorsed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/opinion/22qaddafi.html?_r=1&amp;ref=opinion">a single binational Jewish-Arab state in Palestine</a> rather than the status quo or a two-state solution.</p>

They think they may have found one. The bankers plan to buy &#8216;life settlements,&#8217; life insurance policies that ill and elderly people sell for cash — $400,000 for a $1 million policy, say, depending on the life expectancy of the insured person. Then they plan to &#8216;securitize&#8217; these policies, in Wall Street jargon, by packaging hundreds or thousands together into bonds. They will then resell those bonds to investors&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Every once in a while, some wide-eyed idealist&#8212;I believe that the most well-known such thinker was libertarian Milton Friedman&#8212;suggests that the real problem that poor people have is <em>not enough money</em>. Therefore, they say, the most effective way for the government to lift the poor out of their miserable condition is to <em>give them money</em>.</p>

	<p>Of course, sober-minded folks are ready to click their tongues and say, how <em>simplistic</em> to believe that poverty is caused by having <em>not enough money</em>. Poverty is caused by a broken family, by insufficient education, by corrupt moral values, by paternalistic government programs that sap individual initiative, by&#8230; well, there is no shortage of disagreement about what the cause is, but all these wiser heads agree that if you <em>give them money</em>, poor people will just fritter away their largesse and be no better off in the long run. The proper way to help poor people, then, is to give them something other than money, or perhaps give them money with strings attached to ensure they spend it properly, and of course this requires a bureaucracy staffed by sober-minded folks to guide monitor the progress of their poor clients.</p>

	<p>Despite all this accumulated wisdom, a few wide-eyed idealists have scraped together enough donations to find villagers in some desperately poor corner of Africa and <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,642310,00.html">give them money</a>. It seems to be working out well so far.</p>

	<p>(To be fair to the sober-minded side: around 1970, the US government tried a Friedmanesque negative income tax in what was called the &#8220;Graduated Work Incentive Experiment&#8221; or the &#8220;New Jersey Income Experiment&#8221; and, well, I guess the results of the experiment were not enough to convince Congress to give us all a negative income tax. To report further on this I will need to dig up one or two actual books.)</p>

	<p><strong>η</strong> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_income_tax_credit">Earned Income Tax Credit</a> functions as a negative income tax, sorta kinda.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>News coverage of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/22/sports/22runner.html?_r=1&amp;em">the controversy regarding whether or not track star Caster Semenya is “really” a woman</a> is giving everyone a crash course in postmodern gender theory. Can one&#8217;s chromosomes determine once and for all whether a person is &#8220;really&#8221; a man or a woman? Nope. Shape of genitalia? Nope. Hormones? Nope. Now that we&#8217;ve reviewed the general issue of <em>how subjective</em> sex attribution can be, I&#8217;d like to focus on who, in this case, <em>gets to be the subject</em>.</p>

	<p>In tough cases any rule for determining sex is going to be arbitrary, but whose arbitrary rules are governing Ms. Semenya? Nobody (of course!) cares about <em>her own</em> opinion regarding which sex she belongs to. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/aug/23/caster-semenya-athletics-gender">The judgement of the family and community in which she was raised</a> also counts for nothing. The laws of the country where she is a citizen do not apply.</p>

	<p>Instead, this 18-year-old is going to be examined by &#8220;a geneticist, an endocrinologist, a gynecologist, a psychologist and so forth&#8221; (Ms. Semenya, if the psychologist asks you if you played with dolls as a child, <em>say yes</em>), who will put her through &#8220;chromosome testing, gynecological investigation, all manner of things, organs, X-rays, scans&#8221;. These worthies will report their judgements to the International Association of Athletics Federations, which will decide whether or not Ms. Semenya qualifies as a female athlete. Does she get five points for a vagina, lose a point for facial hair, gain another ten if she menstruates, with 100 points needed to qualify? Or is this like figure skating, where the American, Russian, French, and British judges will each score her based on some combination of technical merit and aesthetic judgement, and then her average score will determine her fate? Nobody is saying.</p>

	<p>No objective procedure&#8212;no medical exam or legal certificate or other kind of attestation&#8212;could have settled the question before Ms. Semenya competed and thus prevented her from suffering this indignity. The only thing she could have done was avoid falling under suspicion in the first place. So, girls, pay attention: If you want to become an international track star, it&#8217;s not enough to be the fastest woman on two legs. You have to be the fastest <em>lady</em>.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to protect myself from the headaches of another massive hard-drive failure by backing up our home systems to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>, first by using <a href="http://jungledisk.com/">JungleDisk</a>, and more recently by using <a href="http://duplicity.nongnu.org/">duplicity</a>. (JungleDisk is a fine program&#8212;it&#8217;s one of the few pieces of software running on my Linux box that I&#8217;ve put down money for, and I&#8217;ve never regretted doing so&#8212;but the basic version is oriented towards backing up one user&#8217;s personal files, and knows nothing of Unix ownership, file permissions, etc.)</p>

	<p>The one problem with this approach is that we have about 20 GB of music files on our desktop system, and our <span class="caps">DSL</span> connection is only 128 Kbps upstream, so the music stuff is not being backed up as frequently as everything else.</p>

	<p>But this past week, we were on vacation in New York, and my wife and I independently hit on this brilliant idea: start One Great Big Backup right before we leave, and it should be done before we get back.  (Well &#8230; mostly done.  I should have worked out the math first. But that was the least of my problems.)</p>

	<p>So I set One Great Big Backup to kick off at 10:00 a.m. Sunday morning, come back at about 4:30 Friday afternoon (the bus having arrived in Boston an hour and a half late), and discover that our system is even less responsive than it usually is under high load, and the console is printing out disturbing messages regarding the hard drive, containing cheerful messages like this:</p>

	<p><code>SError: { PHYRdyChg CommWake Dispr LinkSeq TrStaTrns }</code></p>

	<p>After a panicked reboot and some more panicked fumbling with <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/e2fsck">fsck</a>, I gave up and shut the machine down.</p>

	<p>Did I mention that this is the computer that controls our X10 system for turning lights on and off at appropriate times?</p>

	<p>Anyway, on Saturday night, I did a more sober assessment of the damage, and determined that:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>One Great Big Backup had not finished and seemed hopelessly corrupt, so the music files had not been backed up.</li>
		<li>The most recent backup of our music to JungleDisk had happened, umm, some time in July of 2008.</li>
		<li>Regular daily backups had been going on as expected, so at least the regular desktop files were safe.</li>
		<li>Googling the cheerful messages from the hard drive turned up advice along the lines of &#8220;hard drives are cheap, do you really want to keep using one that&#8217;s flaking out on you?&#8221;</li>
	</ol>

	<p>So today&#8217;s adventures included a journey to <a href="http://www.microcenter.com/">Micro Center</a>, where we picked up</p>

	<ol>
		<li>a Hitachi 500-GB internal <span class="caps">SATA</span> hard drive, on sale</li>
		<li>a Hitachi 640-GB external <span class="caps">USB</span> hard drive, on sale</li>
		<li>an Ubuntu 8.10 LiveCD</li>
	</ol>

	<p>When I tried to install the first of these items, a little nub of plastic broke off the end of the <span class="caps">SATA</span> cable.  Also, the drive came with <em>two</em> machine screws, wheres the drive bay in our desktop machine requires <em>four</em> screws on a drive to keep it in place. Maybe that&#8217;s why these things were on sale.  Hopefully, the Micro Center folks won&#8217;t give us grief about replacing it tomorrow.</p>

	<p>The second one seems to be working so far as well as one might expect, although <span class="caps">VFAT</span>&#8217;s limitations on file names and size make my attempts at recovery and forensics&#8230; well, I&#8217;ve used about as much creativity as I think I can stand right now.</p>

	<p>The third item, though, has worked like a charm: I booted from the CD, plugged in the external drive, mounted the partition that had the music on it, and as far as I can tell, all those files were copied over without a hitch. I would have backed up <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery#Data%20Recovery%20from%20damaged%20filesystem%20or%20drive">disk images</a> from the broken drive to the external one as well, but then I ran into <span class="caps">VFAT</span>&#8217;s 4-GB-per-file limit. See previous comment about creativity.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Many bloggers whose hard drives I am not fit to defragment have commented on Prof. Gates&#8217;s arrest for the dastardly crime of Residing While Black. Others are no doubt compiling enough links to create a definitive record of commentary on this case. I humbly submit for the archives <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/crime_control_/2009/07/nightmare_on_ware_street.php">this analysis by Lowry Heussler</a> which cross-examines, as it were, <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/Police%20report%20on%20Gates%20arrest.PDF">the arresting officer&#8217;s own report</a>.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>As so often happens with documentary evidence, a person seeking to create a false impression spends lots of time nailing down the elements he thinks will establish his goal, but forgets about the larger picture. Under color of law, Crowley entered a residence to investigate a possible break-in, and after his probable cause had evaporated, he continued to act under color of law, but without any justifiable purpose. And he covered it up with false charges. Figuring that his best defense was a criminal charge, Crowley did what bad cops do. He decided he would look better if Gates looked worse. Perhaps one day cops will figure out that trumped-up charges worsen a case of investigating something that turns out not to have been a crime. It is horribly wrong when police officers falsely accuse an injured arrestee of A&amp;B PO (&#8220;assault and battery on a police officer,&#8221; a felony) but at least there is some logic to the lie. If a disorderly conduct charge follows an investigation of a non-crime, chances are pretty good that the cop handled himself badly&#8230;.</p>
		<p>If Crowley lied about Gates&#8217; statements, he should not be permitted to investigate crimes ever again. Investigation for the government is a sacred responsibility. Unless Cambridge investigates and acts properly, we&#8217;re ratifying his actions. We&#8217;re also putting the public at risk of false arrest and police persecution. Lying cops are like biting dogs. After the first bite we can&#8217;t say we weren&#8217;t warned. Conservatives love &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; for crime. Could we have zero tolerance for testilying?</p>

	<p>Clark was diagnosed with heart failure as an infant, but because she had lung problems related to her heart disease, conventional treatment would have involved transplanting a heart <em>and</em> lungs. Instead, her doctors grafted a donor heart <em>onto</em> her own (see the diagram), in the hope that with less workload, her own heart would develop enough muscle strength to function by itself. She spent just over ten years steering between her own immune system rejecting the donor heart, and suffering cancer related to immunosuppressant therapy. Finally, the doctors removed the donor heart. She is now a healthy sixteen-year-old girl. </p>

	<p>Quoth the <i>Globe</i>: &#8220;[I]f doctors can figure out how Clark’s heart healed itself and develop a treatment from that mechanism, many other cardiac patients could benefit. At the moment, doctors aren’t sure how that regeneration happens.&#8221;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I would have thought that the pain of unmedicated childbirth has very little in common with the pain of getting woken every three hours by a crying infant, not to mention the pain of one&#8217;s plans interrupted by a pre-schooler&#8217;s fourteenth tantrum of the day, not to mention&#8230; you get the idea. And therefore, I would have thought that suffering one of these pains does not really prepare you for the others, except perhaps through the psychology of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs">misaccounting for sunk costs</a>.</p>

	<p>But hey, what do I know?  I&#8217;m not <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/12/pregnancy-pain-natural-birth-yoga">a university professor who is also one of the most influential midwives in Britain</a>.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;A large number of women want to avoid pain. Some just don&#8217;t fancy the pain [of childbirth]. More women should be prepared to withstand pain,&#8221; he told the Observer. &#8220;Pain in labour is a purposeful, useful thing, which has quite a number of benefits, such as preparing a mother for the responsibility of nurturing a newborn baby.&#8221;</p>
		<p>&#8230;</p>
		<p>&#8220;Over recent decades there has been a loss of &#8216;rites of passage&#8217; meaning to childbirth, so that pain and stress are viewed negatively,&#8221; said Walsh. Patients should be told that labour pain is a timeless component of the &#8220;rites of passage&#8221; transition to motherhood, he added.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Snark aside, one can certainly make a case that in general, <em>anaesthetics are overused</em> in labor and that patients should weigh the risks against the benefits. But replacing a foolish orthodoxy (&#8220;the more medical interventions, the better&#8221;) with a foolish counter-orthodoxy (&#8220;if you take the epidural, you&#8217;re a bad mommy&#8221;) is not progress.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Many political figures itching for the elimination of the Jewish state are also fond of antisemitic pseudo-histories of the Jewish nation, e.g., Holocaust denial. If these leaders studied actual Jewish history, instead of tripe like <i>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</i>, they would be rushing to the negotiating table&#8212;not out of sympathy for Jewish suffering or an appreciation of the historical Jewish claim to Palestine, but as a hard-headed political strategy. They would realize that their best hope to eliminate the State of Israel is to make peace with it.</p>

	<p>Some of my Jewish readers are probably nodding their heads at this point. For everyone else, I will elaborate.</p>

	<p>Thousands of years of oppression, at the hands of virtually every sort of political system, has taught our people some odd habits. When the enemy is breathing down our neck, we can <em>usually</em> put aside our internal differences and find some expedient path to survive together. But when our lives our easy and our host country rules us with a light hand, we eventually turn on one another. It is as if we are so busy <em>looking for the next enemy</em> that when none appears from outside our community, we project its image onto our neighbors.</p>

	<p>This cultural tic, as it were, goes back to Biblical times. The second half of Exodus through the end of Deuteronomy portrays a string of revolts against Moses&#8217; leadership, revolts which occurred even as overt miracles were performed for the nation every day. King Solomon ruled a united, peaceful, and prosperous Israel for forty years, and his successor did not rule for a week before his kingdom was divided. Flavius Josephus&#8217;s <i>The Jewish War</i> does not begin with a Roman <em>invasion</em> of Palestine; rather, it opens by describing a struggle among Jewish factions for the high priesthood, in which one faction tried to gain the upper hand by <em>inviting the Romans in</em>.</p>

	<p>If you consider these sources unreliable, consider more recent history, within the memory of most adults.</p>

	<p>Popular anticipation of Middle Eastern peace hit a high-water mark in 1993, when the Oslo Accords were signed, and gave way to the usual pessimism at some point before 2000, when the Second Intifada began. Obviously there were some Jews who considered the Oslo process a disaster and wanted the state to renounce it as soon as possible, but they were a minority, especially in the early years. So where, in that optimistic age, did most Jews refocus their anxiety? On one another. Sephardic Jews tried to shake themselves free from the Ashkenazi political power structure. Liberal Jews, with strong support from the Diaspora, fought against the Orthodox state-religious establishment. Secular Israeli intellectuals began speaking of a &#8220;post-Zionist Israel&#8221;. Conflicts between labor and capital moved closer to the political foreground.</p>

	<p>And now that Israelis of all persuasions expect missiles rather than peace to be just over the horizon, all these issues have gone to the back burner, and the range of political options has constricted. I remember when the Israeli political system was embroiled in controversy over &#8220;who is a Jew&#8221;, as representatives from the Reform and Conservative movements lobbied to have their converts given the same legal privileges as Orthodox converts. Now, the big controversy over Israeli conversion is <em>within</em> the Orthodox movement, as rabbis from the right wing of Orthodoxy invalidate conversions performed by rabbis whom they consider insufficiently Orthodox.</p>

	<p>If the Arab and Muslim world eventually does forge peace with the State of Israel, and history repeats itself, what will happen?  All those old fissures in the Jewish community&#8212;Israel vs. Diaspora, Ashkenazi vs. Sephardi, secular vs. religious, religious brand-<i>X</i> vs. religious brand-<i>Y</i>, rich vs. poor, nationalist vs. universalist&#8212;will have room to broaden and deepen. If the Israeli state (which is to say, whatever unstable coalition can get 61 votes in the Knesset) takes a side in any of these conflicts, the losing side will impugn the legitimacy of the state itself. Eventually, members of one not-quite-powerful-enough faction (it hardly matters which) will decide that they would rather ally with their Arab neighbors (or Iran, or some more distant power) than suffer defeat by their fellow Jews. And then new verses can be added to a very old dirge.</p>

	<p>We as a nation have gotten very good at reacting to war, and in the lulls between wars, we are good at preparing for the next one. We would do well to prepare ourselves for peace, as well. We can prepare to make a different kind of history.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>When Cory Doctorow&#8217;s <a href="http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/">Little Brother</a> came out last year, various geeky and liberal bloggers I respect lauded it as A Very Important Book That Today&#8217;s Young People Ought To Read. I finally read it and my general reaction was: <em>this</em> is A Very Important Book?  <span class="caps">WTF</span>?</p>

	<p>Obligatory non-spoilery plot summary: Marcus a.k.a. “w1n5t0n” is a high-school student with a gift for hacking, in both the &#8220;doing stuff with computers&#8221; sense and the &#8220;evading security systems&#8221; sense. In the wake of a terrorist attack on San Francisco, he is detained without warrant, interrogated about his nonexistent terrorist connections, and finally released with an &#8220;we&#8217;ve got our eye on you, boy&#8221; warning. He vows <span class="caps">REVENGE</span>. Hijinks ensue.</p>

	<p>I should be a sucker for a novel with this kind of setup, so why did it so thoroughly turn me off?  Let me count the ways:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Marcus is a geek wish-fulfillment fantasy. He sneaks through his school&#8217;s high-tech security screens! He passes out <span class="caps">DVD</span>s containing a hardened Linux distribution to his friends and classmates, who accept them eagerly! Hundreds of people who only know him over a carefully anonymized network acclaim him as his leader, even as he humbly denies being in control of anything! He shows a teacher who&#8217;s a true patriot by quoting the Declaration of Independence!<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn4439573294a4d8150c381d">1</a></sup> As his first part-time job, while still a high-school student, he implements a cryptographic protocol! <em>Girls want to have sex with him!</em> I realize that the main character of a thriller novel is usually larger than life, but this goes far for my taste; Marcus is so perfect that there&#8217;s no room in the novel for him to demonstrate personal growth.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn13230009614a4d8150c3c03">2</a></sup> And why should he? He was right about everything on the first page and equally right on the last.</li>
		<li>The book is stuffed with infodumps about computer technology, the glorious Sixties, and other things that the author clearly thinks You Should Know, but which do nothing to advance the plot or reveal the character. It&#8217;s almost as bad as the sex scenes in a <a href="http://www.rdrop.com/~/wyvern/data/houseplants.html">Gor</a> novel. Here, I&#8217;ll prove it: I randomly open the book to pages 258&ndash;259. On page 267,<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn10196747234a4d8150c3fe9">3</a></sup> the third paragraph begins &#8220;It&#8217;s unbelievable today, but there was a time when the government classed crypto as a munition&#8230;&#8221; and goes on for a whole page.</li>
		<li>Given the undercurrent of the author hectoring the next generation about what they should care about, the book&#8217;s flirtation with youth-worship&#8212;at one point Marcus&#8217;s movement adopts the slogan &#8220;Don&#8217;t trust anyone over 25&#8221;&#8212;is just&#8230; odd. And as regime-threatening movements go, Marcus&#8217;s network is curiously homogenous. They&#8217;re young. They&#8217;re geeky enough to ruin a perfectly good video-game console to run Linux on it. They seem to have the same taste in music and recreation (two critical points in the plot involve a rock concert and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game"><span class="caps">LARP</span></a>, respectively). Most of the main characters are white or East Asian; the role of racism in the government&#8217;s suppression of civil liberties is barely mentioned.</li>
		<li>Most people willing to risk arrest and long-term detention for exercising their civil rights are not <em>just</em> trying to exercise their civil rights, but trying to use those civil rights <em>to accomplish something</em>.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn11775791294a4d8150c43d2">4</a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen_v._California">Paul Robert Cohen</a> appealed to the Supreme Court for the right to display &#8220;Fuck the Draft&#8221; on his jacket; while the legal system only cared about the first word, Cohen cared about the entire sentence. By contrast, in <i>Little Brother</i>, the movement&#8217;s enthusiasm for civil liberties is completely disconnected from any larger political program. Marcus and his friends want to &#8220;take it [the country] back&#8221;, but for what do they want to do with the country once they have it? End the war in Iraq? Liberalize the immigration laws? Repeal the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that have discouraged high-tech startups from floating initial public offerings? I have no idea.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>The Israeli author Amos Oz once said that when he has a question to which he knows the answer, he writes an essay; when he has a question to which he doesn&#8217;t know the answer, he writes a novel. I&#8217;ve enjoyed Doctorow&#8217;s previous work&#8212;both fiction and non&#8212;but <i>Little Brother</i> is a novel that should have been an essay.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn4439573294a4d8150c381d"><sup>1</sup> Had I been teaching that class, I would have pointed out that John Adams had signed the Declaration of Independence as a delegate from Massachusetts and then, twenty-two years later, signed the Alien and Sedition Acts.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn13230009614a4d8150c3c03"><sup>2</sup> Losing his virginity doesn&#8217;t count.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn10196747234a4d8150c3fe9"><sup>3</sup> OK, a Gor novel would have the sex scene within <em>five</em> pages of any random selection, not ten, but then again, the Gor novels are printed in smaller type.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn11775791294a4d8150c43d2"><sup>4</sup> Cf. Stanley Fish&#8217;s remark, in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GtdrpVZpTfUC&amp;dq=stanley+fish+free+speech+no+such+thing&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2XJNSqe2B4uXtge0iYCjBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4">There&#8217;s No Such Thing As Free Speech and It&#8217;s a Good Thing, Too</a>, that the only speech that can be completely free is speech that nobody cares about listening to.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I read a couple of books recently that are so thick and comprehensive that a proper review of each would be, well, thick and comprehensive.  In the interest of saying something about them before October, I will dare to review them improperly.</p>

	<p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ePiReZWp0NwC&amp;printsec=frontcover">A Splendid Exchange</a>: Watching my seven-year-old and four-year-old trade Pok&eacute;mon cards, I remember Adam Smith&#8217;s remark about &#8220;the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange&#8221;. This book traces the history of that propensity (and of  attempts to regulate it) in the Western world and everyone who traded with it, and even dips into the <em>pre</em>history; it starts with commerce in obsidian arrowheads and copper ore, and ends with the riots disrupting Seattle&#8217;s World Trade Organization talks.</p>

	<p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=vSCra8jUI2EC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=mann+1491">1491</a>: You learned about the American Indians in school, right? Mumblety-mumble thousand years ago, their ancestors all came over the &#8220;land bridge&#8221; from Siberia to North America, right? And there they lived as nomadic hunters and gatherers surrounded by pristine wilderness, right?  And so at the time Columbus arrived, the New World was thinly populated, right? Wrong, wrong, wrong.</p>

	<p>I will resist the temptation to elaborate by restating my reviews even more succinctly: Good books.  Read.  Grunt.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>During my brief stay at yeshiva in Israel, we toured some of the archeological sites near Tiberias, and our guide pointed out a number of details about the Roman civil engineering from two thousand years ago.  <i>A tour guide who appreciates technology,</i> I thought.  <i>Cool!</i></p>

	<p>A few months ago, I read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eupalinian_aqueduct">the tunnel of Eupalinos</a>, an aqueduct dug through a mountain on the Greek island of Samos by two teams starting at opposite sides. The tunnel is an impressive work of engineering when you consider that during the sixth century <span class="caps">BCE</span>, when it was dug, its surveyors had no magnetic compasses, nothing resembling modern surveying instruments, and possibly not even much geometry&#8212;Euclid&#8217;s <i>Elements</i> was written two centuries later. And yet, the two excavation teams intercepted each other in the middle of the mountain, just as Eupalinos had planned. <i>Wow,</i> I thought. <i>If I could ever do a Geek&#8217;s Tour of Europe, that tunnel would be one of my stops.</i></p>

	<p>So, when I heard someone had published <a href="http://www.geekatlas.com/">The Geek Atlas</a>, the first thing I did was look at <a href="http://www.geekatlas.com/page/3338541:Page:164">the map</a> to see if the tunnel of Eupalinos was on the list. To my surprise, it was not; in fact, not a single marker lay in Greece. The only place mentioned in Italy is the <a href="http://www.whatsonwhen.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=event&amp;event_id=169093">Tempio Voltiano</a>, a museum dedicated to Alessandro Volta; nothing about classical Roman engineering <em>here</em>. The Neolithic excavations at <a href="http://www.catalhoyuk.com/">Çatalhöyük</a> are also off the list, but surely I am not the only nerd who trembles at the image of <em>a nine-thousand-year-old city</em>.</p>

	<p>Perplexed, I shuffled the map to see what <em>was</em> in this atlas, and came across a marker near Boston. What local landmark did the author consider worth including among his 128 selections? <a href="http://web.mit.edu/museum/">The <span class="caps">MIT</span> Museum.</a></p>

	<p><i>Oh, for the love of God and Jerome Weisner,</i> I thought, <i>you have got to be kidding.</i></p>

	<p>My wife and I <em>went</em> to the <span class="caps">MIT</span> Museum in January, using our alumni status to get free admission, and we cannot in good conscience advise anyone to pay their own money to get in there. There are a few exhibits related to current research at the Institute, some kinetic sculptures that somebody presumably considers &#8220;art&#8221;, and a <em>lot</em> about our alma mater&#8217;s storied history. If you&#8217;re an <span class="caps">MIT</span> dean who wants to schlep naches from your department&#8217;s work being on exhibit to the public, or a rich and elderly alum looking to stoke your nostalgia for &#8220;Tech&#8221;, maybe you&#8217;ll like that kind of thing. Everyone else can give it a pass.</p>

	<p>If you&#8217;re a geek visiting Boston and looking for something touristy, I can recommend the <a href="http://www.mos.org/">Museum of Science</a>, especially if you have kids. There&#8217;s also the <a href="http://www.hmnh.harvard.edu/">Harvard Museum of Natural History</a>. Or, heck, you can just walk into <span class="caps">MIT</span> itself, wander the halls, and look for posters describing current research. And if you&#8217;re looking for something elsewhere in the world&#8230; I have no idea.</p>

	<p>If anyone out there has come across a <em>real</em> geek atlas, please let me know. In the meantime, I&#8217;m saving my pennies for a trip to Samos and Çatalhöyük.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Narratives of transsexuality aimed at a general audience, both in print and online, are a genre unto themselves, and one of the conventions of the genre is the tone, directed at cissexual (i.e. non-trans) readers, of &#8220;please understand me, because if you understand me, then you couldn&#8217;t possibly condemn me&#8221;.  The refreshing thing about Julia Serano&#8217;s <a href="http://www.juliaserano.com/whippinggirl.html">Whipping Girl</a> is that it breaks that frame, and tells us &#8220;please understand <em>yourselves</em>, because if you understand the prejudices that our culture has taught you, then you can learn to respect me&#8221;.</p>

	<p>For example, consider the issue of &#8220;passing&#8221;, which consumes a lot of the literature devoted to transsexuality. (I have to include <a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/article/the-pink-and-blue-highlighters-in-your-brain">something I myself blogged five years ago</a> in this indictment.) Serano points out that the language of &#8220;passing&#8221; puts the focus on the trans person, who either succeeds or fails at &#8220;passing&#8221; as his or her self-identified gender. But it ignores the role of <em>other people</em> who pass judgement (ahem) on the people they encounter, and who stigmatize anyone whose gender presentation they consider deviant. (Gender-noncomformant cissexuals sometimes run afoul of this stigma<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn3467870524a3dc1f1c9eed">1</a></sup>, but we don&#8217;t usually describe their experience as a failure to &#8220;pass&#8221;.) Taking for granted that everyone else will acknowledge your self-identified gender&#8212;assuming that if someone does misidentify your gender, then your peers will agree that the problem is with them, not you&#8212;is one aspect of what Serano calls &#8220;cissexual privilege&#8221;.</p>

	<p>With insights like this, Serano attacks the received wisdom of many communities: not just mainstream &#8220;straight&#8221; society and media, but also the medical establishment, the &#8220;queer studies&#8221; world (Foucault and his intellectual descendants), lesbian and queer communities, and the feminist world.</p>

	<p>With regard to feminism, she has critiques of the &#8220;feminism is all about the specialness of women, by which of course we mean women who have been raised as girls&#8221; faction of the movement (no surprise there), the &#8220;let&#8217;s measure feminist progress by how many women are becoming doctors and lawyers&#8221; faction, and the &#8220;let&#8217;s deconstruct the gender binary and live androgynously ever after&#8221; faction. But she comes not to undermine feminism, but to improve it.</p>

	<p>Serano&#8217;s model of sexism, I humbly suggest, is worth adding to the Feminism 101 curriculum. She distinguishes between <em>traditional</em> sexism, the belief that masculinity is superior to femininity, and <em>oppositional</em> sexism, the belief that men should be masculine and women should be feminine. A woman (i.e., someone universally regarded as female&#8212;let&#8217;s bracket the trans issues for a minute) who takes on a stereotypically female role benefits from oppositional sexism, but is harmed by traditional sexism.  A woman who goes into stereotypically male endeavors benefits from traditional sexism (e.g., higher pay and prestige) but is harmed by oppositional sexism. A &#8220;manly man&#8221; benefits from both, and an effeminate man is harmed by both.  This tension explains why trans women encounter <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-rowe/krxq-sacramento-radio-hos_b_210637.html">extreme reactions</a> and trans men are barely noticed by mainstream society, but it also explains a lot of other things about the way sexism operates in society, even among cis heterosexual men and women. (For instance, Serano observes that the modern feminist movement has done a lot to fight oppositional sexism but not so much to fight traditional sexism, and suggests that this is why many straight, cissexual, <em>femme</em> women will say &#8220;I&#8217;m not a feminist&#8221; even as they enjoy many of the rights that feminists have won for them.)</p>

	<p>Which is why this is a book that everyone should read, regardless of their gender, how masculine or feminine they are, their attitude towards transsexuality, or their attitude towards feminism itself.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn3467870524a3dc1f1c9eed"><sup>1</sup> If I recall correctly, one of the very first <i>Dykes To Watch Out For</i> strips was about how a butch dyke should respond to a woman who rebukes her for being in &#8220;the <em>ladies&#8217;</em> room&#8221;.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Edward Kritzler&#8217;s <i><a href="http://www.jewishpiratesofthecaribbean.com/">Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean</a></i> is a mediocre book about a fascinating topic.</p>

	<p>The topic is the Jews and <i>conversos</i> (Jews who converted, generally under duress, to Catholicism) who, despite official bans, joined the Spanish conquest of the New World and who, when the Inquisition caught up with their relatives, helped other European powers pillage the Spanish. (&#8220;Jewish Privateers of the Caribbean&#8221; would be a more accurate title, albeit less marketable.) When the Church&#8217;s interest in the <i>conversos</i> outweighed their usefulness to Spain, they assisted the Portuguese; when Spain and Portugal united and the Inquisition swept the Portuguese colonies, they teamed up with the Dutch (some fled to New Amsterdam) and the English. (According to Kritzler, the British conquest of Jamaica was assisted by the Jewish community there; Columbus&#8217;s heirs, the owners of the island, had protected them from the Inquisition, and when it looked like that protection was about to run out, they invited Cromwell to invade.)</p>

	<p>The most interesting figure in the book is Rabbi Samuel Palache, who served the Sultan of Morocco as a privateer <em>and</em> served Amsterdam&#8217;s Jewish community as the president of Neveh Shalom, the first non-clandestine synagogue in Holland, founded in 1612. (By 1620, the Neveh Shalom congregation had split into three factions. Some things never change.)</p>

	<p>Alas, this book could have used a better editor. The narrative seems to jerk from one colony or European state to another, from one decade to another, cramming in details at the expense of narrative flow. The overall effect is like listening to a garrulous older relative fill you in on some seamy family history; it can be entertaining to listen to, but the next day you can&#8217;t remember if Uncle Murray was a bagman for the mob and Uncle Moishe ran guns for the Irgun, or vice versa.</p>

	<p>Furthermore, the book could have used a better historian. A great deal of the evidence Kritzler provides regarding Jewish activity in the Caribbean comes from the files of the Inquisition itself. Maybe the Inquisition&#8217;s informants were absolutely correct when the talked about secret Jews conspiring with their foreign co-religionists to undermine the rule of Spain in the Americas; they certainly had motive, means, and opportunity. Then again, as recent history reminds us, a confession extracted under torture reveals more about what the torturing regime wants to be true than about what actually happened. A more careful writer would have not only collected all the claims made about Jews in the Caribbean but also weighed the credibility of each source, and made it clear which of the most lurid claims were actually corroborated.</p>

	<p>This topic really deserves a better book, or even two or three better books. Perhaps <i>Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean</i> would be of higher journalistic quality if the author were not using it to tout his other enterprises. Within the book, he claims to have identified the location of <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">LOST</span> <span class="caps">GOLD</span> <span class="caps">MINE</span> OF <span class="caps">COLUMBUS</span>, and on the Web page, he seems more interested in promoting himself as a tour guide ($1250/week, plus expenses) than as an author.  Well, as Rabbi Palache may have told his mother at one point, it&#8217;s a living.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>[The following is based on a <i>tikkun leil Shavuot</i> talk that I gave at <a href="http://www.ktmshul.org">my synagogue</a> last week.]</p>

	<p class="mtb">There is a mishnah in the tractate <i>Nazir</i> that I first learned from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Book-Jewish-Humor/dp/0061138134/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1244342142&amp;sr=8-1">The Big Book of Jewish Humor</a>, of all places:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><img src="http://ropine.com/img/koi.png" style="float: right; width: 238px; height: 140px;" title="excerpt from Nazir 34a." alt="excerpt from Nazir 34a." /> Someone sees a koy [an animal that the rabbis were not sure whether to classify as wild or domesticated] and says
	<ol>
		<li>&#8220;I swear to be a nazirite [see Numbers 6:1-21] if this is a wild animal&#8221;; [others say]</li>
		<li>&#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if this is not a wild animal&#8221;;</li>
		<li>&#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if this is a domesticated animal&#8221;;</li>
		<li>&#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if this is not a domesticated animal&#8221;;</li>
		<li>&#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if this is both a wild animal and a domesticated animal&#8221;;</li>
		<li>&#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if this is neither a wild animal nor a domesticated animal&#8221;;</li>
		<li>&#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if one of you is a nazirite&#8221;;</li>
		<li>&#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if none of you is a nazirite&#8221;;</li>
		<li>&#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if all of you are nazirites&#8221;;</li>
	</ol></p>
		<p>the law is that they are all nazirites.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>But the rabbis, it turns out, may have the last laugh.</p>

	<p>If this mishnah sounds &#8220;illogical&#8221; to contemporary ears, it&#8217;s because to us, &#8220;logic&#8221; is a particular system of deduction that we learned in school, a tradition going back to Aristotle&#8212;what mathematicians call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_logic"><em>classical</em> logic</a>.  But in the early twentieth century [isn&#8217;t it great to talk about &#8220;the twentieth century&#8221; as an era receding into history?], after classical logic had been reduced to axioms, some mathematicians began experimenting with other axioms, just as a chess master might entertain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960">alternative rule sets for chess</a>. One of these alternatives is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic">intuitionistic logic</a>, which is just like classical logic except that it lacks <em>the law of the excluded middle</em>&#8212;the axiom that every proposition must be either true or false.</p>

	<p>(If you&#8217;re a geek who works with databases you may be familiar with &#8220;three-valued logic&#8221;, in which Boolean values may be true, false, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_(SQL)"><span class="caps">NULL</span></a>.  Intuitionistic logic is <em>not</em> three-valued logic. Nor is it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic">fuzzy logic</a>, in which a statement&#8217;s truthiness can be measured on a continuum from zero [totally false] to one [totally true]. The axioms of intuitionistic logic <em>neither</em> admit the law of the excluded middle <em>nor</em> define any third alternative to truth and falsehood.)</p>

	<p>Let us assume that if you make a conditional oath, the condition is <em>presumed to be true</em>, and if you want to wiggle out of the oath later, you have the burden of proving the condition false. So if P is some statement that can neither be proven nor disproven, &#8220;I am a nazirite if P&#8221; renders you a nazirite, and so does &#8220;I am a nazirite if not-P&#8221;. By that principle, the first six oath-takers are uncontroversially nazirites, and there are several ways, depending on your logic system, to prove that the seventh one is as well.</p>

	<p>By the time that we get to the eighth man, though, we have to consider what &#8220;I am a nazirite if none of you is a nazirite&#8221; means. If it means &#8220;I am a nazirite if <em>the law would not declare any of you to be nazirites</em>”, then the eighth man is off the hook, because, as we see, all seven of his predecessors end up nazirites. But since the halakhic judgement comes at the very <em>end</em> of the mishnah, maybe we are not allowed to interpret the eighth statement this way; perhaps, at the time the man took an oath, he had no idea what the law would declare, and therefore we cannot recursively apply the law&#8217;s judgement to interpret the validity of the oath.</p>

	<p>So alternatively, we could interpret it as &#8220;I am a nazirite if <em>none of the conditions that you imposed on your oaths are true</em>”. And in order to wriggle out of the oath, the eighth man would have to prove that <em>at least one</em> of those seven conditions are true. Under classical logic, this is easy: &#8220;either the koy is wild or not-wild, so either the first or the second condition is true, so hand over the Manishevitz&#8221;. But under intuitionistic logic, the eighth man is stuck: he <em>can&#8217;t</em> assume &#8220;either the koy is wild or not-wild&#8221;, so he has to prove <em>which</em> of his predecessors swore by a condition that turned out to be false, which he can&#8217;t do.</p>

	<p>For a reason that will become clear in the next paragraph, I think the mishnah considers &#8220;I am a nazirite if X, who swore another conditional oath, is also a nazirite&#8221; to have an ambiguous interpretation, and therefore considers both of the above possibilities and chooses the stricter one. Which is why the eighth man is also rendered a nazirite.</p>

	<p>Now let&#8217;s consider the ninth. If we interpret &#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if all of you are nazirites&#8221; as &#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if <em>the law would declare all of you to be nazirites</em>”&#8212;look, that&#8217;s exactly what the law does, and he&#8217;s stuck.  But if we interpret it as &#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if <em>all of the conditions that you imposed on your oaths are true</em>”, then he&#8217;s off the hook, because under both intuitionistic and classical logic, a statement cannot simultaneously be true <em>and</em> false, so the koy cannot be simultaneously wild <em>and</em> not-wild. But by the interpretive principle that I suggested in the last paragraph, the law interprets the ninth man&#8217;s statement conservatively, and he cannot use the axiom of non-contradition to escape.  Thus he, like his eight fellows, is a nazirite.</p>

	<p>(Note that none of the characters in our mishnah say &#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if this is a wild animal <em>and not a wild animal</em>.” Such a statement would not render you a nazirite, although it would earn you a flogging for the sin making a pointless oath.)</p>

	<p>And so, seen through the lens of intuitionistic logic, our mishnah is a little more reasonable, but, I hope, no less funny.</p>

	<p class="mtb">Is this common thread between second-century Jewish law and twentieth-century mathematics a mere coincidence?  I think not.</p>

	<p>The early intuitionists were not merely tweaking the rules of logic out of whimsy; they had an agenda. Classical mathematics assumes that &#8220;the truth is out there&#8221; and a mathematician&#8217;s job is to <em>discover</em> the timeless properties of some Platonic realm of numbers, triangles, and so on. The intuitionists believed that <em>the truth is in here</em> (he said, tapping his own forehead); mathematical objects are constructed in the mathematician&#8217;s mind, and you can only prove things about objects that you can construct.</p>

	<p>This attitude has a lot in common with halakhic decision-making. If you have a piece of meat that may or may not be kosher, at a certain point you may need to decide whether or not, in fact, you may eat the meat. If the meat&#8217;s status is confined to some ideal realm where all we can do is speculate &#8220;there exists in this slaughterhouse at least one side of beef such that&#8230;&#8221;, it does us no good. Jewish law gives us procedures by which, based on the incomplete information before us, we can <em>make a decision</em> one way or another. And by using these procedures, we are not merely <em>discovering</em> metaphysical facts about the physical world; instead, we <em>create</em> them.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>One of my pet peeves is hair-shirt environmentalism.</p>

	<p>Since (at least) the 1960s, whenever policy-makers propose some change in environmental law (to reduce air pollution, to increase fuel efficiency, to retard global warming), a parade of grim corporate lobbyists descend on Washington to warn that if this law is passed, prices of essential goods will rise, factories will close, the economy will shrink, and millions will breathe clean air while standing on the unemployment line.</p>

	<p>Environmentalism <em>as it is popularly understood</em> plays into this attitude by focusing our attention on how we should save the planet by limiting our own behavior. We should drive <em>less</em>, eat <em>less</em> meat and <em>less</em> conventionally-grown food, wash with <em>less</em> water, put up with <em>less</em> heat in the winter and <em>less</em> cooling in the summer, etc. Bummer!</p>

	<p>I believe that the tradeoff between environmental quality and economic growth is false, and that as long as environmentalists are trapped into arguing against economic growth, then progress towards a cleaner and safer world will be, shall we say, glacial. So I am always interested to read stuff by environmentalists who show ways out of the tradeoff&#8212;people who can teach us how to tell the grim lobbyists, &#8220;this is not a death knell for the economy, although it might be a death knell for <em>your client&#8217;s business plan</em>.&#8221;</p>

	<p>William McDonough and Michael Braungart are in this camp, and their book <a href="http://www.mcdonough.com/cradle_to_cradle.htm">Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things</a>, is their manifesto. The gist of their book can be divided into two parts: bad news and good news.</p>

	<p>The bad news is that practicing &#8220;reduce, reuse, recycle&#8221; will not, all by itself, save the planet; it will just ensure that we trash the planet <em>more slowly</em>, putting <em>not so much</em> toxic waste into the air and water supply, using <em>not so much</em> irreplaceable fossil fuel. (And sometimes it&#8217;s not clear that we have even that benefit. Recycled paper, for example, has to be bleached in order to be usable, which requires chlorine, creating a different sort of environmental problem.) Trashing the planet slowly is better than doing it quickly, but in the long run, we have to shift to a more radical change in the economy, one in which waste is not just minimized but eliminated entirely.</p>

	<p>The good news is that this is possible, if the people who design industrial processes take care that every &#8220;waste&#8221; involved in producing their product (including the product itself, when discarded) can be &#8220;food&#8221; to make something else, of equal or higher quality.  (A key term they use is &#8220;downcycling&#8221;&#8212;the form of recycling where the next-generation product is of lower quality than the original. Turning bright crisp virgin paper into dingy recycled paper is downcycling. Growing vegetables in compost is not.) One of their case studies involved an upholstery fabric for a Swiss textile mill; because they selected their raw materials carefully, the fabric can be thrown into a compost heap when the user doesn&#8217;t want it any more, and the effluent from the factory was as clean as the water going in.</p>

	<p>McDonough is an architect and Braungart is a lawyer; while they bring their respective professional backgrounds to the book and the combination is useful, it&#8217;s a shame they couldn&#8217;t bring in an economist or political scientist as a third co-author. In economics, pollution is the classic example of a &#8220;negative externality&#8221;, a cost that you impose on other people and don&#8217;t have to pay for yourself. If every textile mill on the planet had to pay the full cost of making its effluent as pure as rainwater, then closed-loop processes would be the industry norm, not a niche market. Would this kind of regulation be feasible and enforcible? Is there another system, easier to implement, that would achieve the same result? Given that we can&#8217;t impose such a regime on all the world&#8217;s economies at one stroke, what would be some useful transitional steps, measures that prevent regulatory arbitrage? McDonough and Braungart don&#8217;t address these questions; they imply that we can make the world a sustainable place by making more virtuous choices <em>as consumers</em> within the existing capitalist economic system, and not by acting <em>as citizens</em> to change the rules by which that system operates. (Such an implication treads on <em>another</em> one of my pet peeves.)</p>

	<p>But all in all, it&#8217;s a good and thought-provoking book. Nature is profligate: a tree produces hundreds of blossoms and fruits, and even though a tiny minority sprout into new trees, the rest are not &#8220;wasted&#8221;. We can be profligate, too: we just need to learn how to be profligate <em>in the right way</em>. It sure beats <a href="http://www.primitiveways.com/Pleistocene.html">the alternative</a>.</p>

	<p>PS: In keeping with the authors&#8217; principles, their book is printed on <a href="http://www.durabooks.com/">a plastic</a> that can be melted down and reconstituted in perpetuity. (The authors say you can even wash the ink off the pages in hot water and reuse the paper directly, although since my copy is a library book, I didn&#8217;t try it.) Given how much paper is truly wasted in the publishing industry, it&#8217;s an interesting concept, although I suspect that e-books will become mainstream before plastic books do.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Every once in a while, I am in a conversation where an obscure issue of kashrut comes up. I refer to the delicacy that our earliest rabbis refer to (when they must) as <i>basar me-holchei shtayim</i>, &#8220;biped meat&#8221;. At first glance, this seems like a simple question to answer, because as we read last Shabbat:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><img src="http://ropine.com/img/long-pig/a1.png" style="float: right;" width="360" height="258" alt="scan of Leviticus [Hebrew]" /> Speak to the Israelite people thus: These are the creatures that you may eat from among all the land animals: any animal that has true hoofs, with clefts through the hoofs, and that chews the cud&#8212;such you may eat. The following, however, of those that either chew the cud or have true hoofs, you shall not eat: the camel&#8212;although it chews the cud, it has no true hoofs: it is unclean for you&#8230; [Leviticus 11:2-4, <span class="caps">NJPS</span>]</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>[N.B.: I&#8217;m going to follow the <span class="caps">NJPS</span>&#8217;s lead in the rest of this essay, and translate <i>tahor</i> as &#8220;clean&#8221; as <i>tamei</i> as &#8220;unclean&#8221;, even though they&#8217;re really technical legal terms that have nothing to do with hygeine.]</p>

	<p>People have no hoofs, therefore they&#8217;re not kosher. Case closed, right?</p>

	<p>But wait! The oral tradition reads the text closely and expounds:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><img src="http://ropine.com/img/long-pig/b1.png" style="float: left;" width="362" height="114" alt="scan from Torat Cohanim [Hebrew]" /> You might think that even biped meat and biped milk are covered by the prohibition against eating [non-kosher animals]; isn&#8217;t it logical? Since, regarding a [non-kosher] land animal, the rules for its abstention [see below] are lenient but the rules for its milk are strict [such milk is not kosher], then regarding a biped, where the rules for its abstention are strict, shouldn&#8217;t the rules for its milk be strict? [To forestall such an interpretation,] Scripture teaches: &#8220;this&#8221; [in Leviticus 11:29, &#8220;this shall be unclean for you&#8221;]: this is unclean, but the milk of a biped is not unclean. Suppose I exclude the milk, which not apply to all [i.e., males don&#8217;t produce it], but I do not exclude the flesh, which applies to all. Scripture teaches: &#8220;the following &#8230; is unclean&#8221; [in 11:4 above]: the following are included in the prohibition against eating, but the meat and milk of a biped are not included in the prohibition against eating. [Torat Cohanim, Shemini 4:4]</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p><img src="http://ropine.com/img/long-pig/b2.png" style="float: right;" width="210" height="365" alt="scan from Mishnah Bechorot [Hebrew]" /> (The stuff about &#8220;abstention&#8221; refers to other ritual-purity laws. For example, if you touch a live human being who is in a state of ritual impurity, you become ritually impure yourself; the laws are much more lenient regarding touching a non-kosher animal.)</p>

	<p>The prohibition against eating non-kosher animal species does not apply to human meat; therefore, it&#8217;s kosher. Case closed, right?</p>

	<p>But wait! Torat Cohanim was making a very narrow point: <em>this particular negative commandment of the Torah</em> is not infringed when you eat your neighbor. The text doesn&#8217;t explicitly say it&#8217;s <em>allowed</em>. So we have to dig deeper.</p>

	<p>The Mishnah, discussing such cases as a donkey giving birth to a cow, mentions an important principle:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8230;what comes from something unclean is unclean, and what comes from something clean is clean. [Bechorot 1:2]</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Judging from what Nachmanides says below, this is the source for the principle that milk from kosher animal species is kosher, and milk from other species is forbidden. So&#8230; Jewish mothers can breastfeed, which implies that their milk is kosher, which implies that their meat is kosher&#8230; right? Maybe.</p>

	<p>Let&#8217;s turn for a moment from breastfeeding to vampirism. The Gemara says:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><img src="http://ropine.com/img/long-pig/b3.png" style="float: left;" width="444" height="337" alt="scan from tractate Keritut [Hebrew and Aramaic]" /> From &#8220;you shall not eat any blood&#8230;&#8221; [Leviticus 7:26] I would learn that even biped blood, egg blood, kosher-grasshopper blood, and fish blood were all included. Scripture teaches: &#8220;&#8230;of fowl or land animal&#8221;. Just as fowl and land animals are distinguished, because they have both lenient and severe uncleanliness and they have prohibitions and permissions [Rashi: they are prohibited from being eaten before they are properly slaughtered, and permitted afterward], and they are in the category of meat, so to with anything that has lenient uncleanliness. I exclude biped blood because [a biped] has severe uncleanliness but not lenient uncleanliness. [Keritut 20b]</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>On the other hand, the Tosefta says:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><img src="http://ropine.com/img/long-pig/b4.png" style="float: right;" width="429" height="103" alt="scan from Tosefta Keritut [Hebrew]" /> &#8230;Biped blood and egg blood and insect blood are forbidden, but one is not punished for it. Fish blood and kosher-grasshopper blood are permitted. [Tosefta Keritut 2:12]</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Another Gemara harmonizes these sources <em>and</em> quotes something resembling our Torat Cohanim excerpt above <em>and</em> lays down the law for both infants and vampires.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><img src="http://ropine.com/img/long-pig/c1.png" style="float: left;" width="362" height="336" alt="scan from tractate Ketubot [Hebrew and Aramaic]" /> The Rabbis taught: <blockquote>One keeps nursing a baby up to twenty-four months; from then on, it is like nursing a lizard&#8212;says Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua says: even four or five years; if he weans after twenty-four months and goes back, then it is like nursing a lizard. The Master says: from then on [after age five?], it&#8217;s like nursing a lizard.</blockquote> Contrast: <blockquote>You might think that biped milk is unclean; isn&#8217;t it logical? Since, regarding a land animal, where the rules for its abstention are lenient but the rules for its milk are strict, then regarding a human, where the rules for abstention are strict, isn&#8217;t it logical that the rules for its milk be strict? Scripture teaches: &#8220;&#8230;the camel, although it chews the cud&#8230; it is unclean for you&#8221;&#8212;it is unclean, but the milk of bipeds is not unclean, but rather, clean. Possibly I should exclude the milk, which is not the same for everyone [the kashrut of the milk depends on the species that produced it], but I should not exclude the blood, which is the same for everyone [the blood of any land animal, even a kosher species, is forbidden]. Scripture teaches: &#8220;it&#8221;&#8212;it is unclean, but biped blood is not unclean, but rather, clean. And Rav Sheishet said: There is not even a [rabbinic] commandment to separate from it.</blockquote> There is no contradiction: this [human milk being clean] is when it is separated [from the body] and that [&#8220;like nursing a lizard&#8221;] is when it is not separated. And with blood, it&#8217;s the reverse, as we learn from a Baraita: Blood that is on the surface of a piece of bread [because someone with bleeding gums bit into it]&#8212;he scrapes it and eats it [the unbloody part], and sucks what is between his teeth, and we are not concerned. [Ketubot 60a; see also Keritut 21b-22a]</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>So for milk and blood, the Gemara learns that there is a distinction between drinking it directly from the source and drinking it from a cup; it&#8217;s only OK to drink blood from the source and only OK, once you&#8217;re beyond nursing age, to drink milk from a cup. (My wife pointed out that from the same pre-Gemara sources, one could argue that it&#8217;s OK to drink <em>your own</em> blood but not anyone else&#8217;s. I&#8217;m not sure why the Gemara didn&#8217;t interpret the sources that way.) But somehow, amid all the discussion of milk and blood, the question of meat has been lost. To recover it, we must jump forward to the medieval sources.</p>

	<p>Rabbeinu Asher (the &#8220;Rosh&#8221;), in his commentary on the above Gemara, opines:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><img src="http://ropine.com/img/long-pig/d1.png" style="float: right;" width="515" height="95" alt="scan from Rosh's commentary on tractate Ketubot [Hebrew]" /> Blood on the surface of a piece of bread&#8212;he scrapes it and eats it, because it could be confused with other blood, because it is separated. For what is between his teeth, he sucks it and swallows it; biped blood is permitted. The reverse is true of milk; if it is not separated, it is forbidden, because one might come to confuse it with the milk of an unclean land animal; but separated, it is permitted. And so it seems with biped meat: to bite it off and eat it is forbidden, because one might come to confuse it with the meat of an unclean land animal, because this is not the way of eating it; perhaps its uncleanliness changes [translation uncertain]; but separated, it is permitted. [Rosh s.v. Ketubot 60a]</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The Rosh explains the rules for human blood and milk as a matter of <i>marit ayin</i>. If I were seen to drink human milk directly from a woman&#8217;s breast, an observer might think that it&#8217;s also OK to drink the milk of a non-kosher animal, as long as one does so in this unusual fashion. To prevent this, the rabbis forbade adults to drink milk from the breast, but human milk from a cup is still OK. He then extrapolates to meat. If I go all <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=moments/30">Mike Tyson</a> on my neighbor, bite off his earlobe, and swallow, an observer might think that it&#8217;s OK to do the same to a pig&#8217;s ear. But if I have a slice of &#8220;long pig&#8221; from a deli plate, no similar confusion would occur.</p>

	<p>Maimonides, however, takes a completely different approach.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><img src="http://ropine.com/img/long-pig/d2.png" style="float: left;" width="348" height="109" alt="scan from Maimonides, Mishnah Torah [Hebrew]" /> A human, even though it is said regarding him &#8220;&#8230;and the human became a living <i>(chayyah)</i> soul&#8221;, is not included among the species of wild animal <i>(chayyah)</i> that are food. Therefore, it is not covered by the prohibition [against eating non-kosher animals]. And one who eats human meat or milk, whether from the living or from the dead, is not flogged. But it is forbidden by a positive commandment, because behold, Scripture counts seven species of wild animal and says &#8220;these are the wild animals that you may eat&#8221;; behold, everything outside of them you shall not eat, and a prohibition classified as a positive commandment is [punished as a] positive commandment. [Mishnah Torah, Hilchot Ma&#8217;achalot Asurot 2:3]</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>What does the last part, &#8220;forbidden by a positive commandment&#8221;, mean? The default punishment for a physical action (as opposed to, say, speech) violating a prohibition of the Torah is flogging, but by default there is <em>no</em> punishment for failing to observe a mandate of the Torah. Even though &#8220;don&#8217;t eat human flesh&#8221; sounds a lot like a prohibition, Maimonides is classifying it among the positive commandments, as an implication of &#8220;only eat animals from the following species&#8221;. So if <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910506,00.html">your plane goes down in the Andes</a> and you, on the brink of starvation, have to choose between eating a pork chop from the galley or one of your dead fellow-passengers, you could make an argument that it&#8217;s better to forego the pork chop. (You could also make an argument that eating people is so self-evidently disgusting that God didn&#8217;t need to explicitly forbid it.)</p>

	<p>Nachmanides, in his commentary on last week&#8217;s parsha, argues against Maimonides:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><img src="http://ropine.com/img/long-pig/d3.png" style="float: right;" width="361" height="375" alt="scan from Nachmanides' commentary on the Torah [Hebrew]" /> The teacher Rabbi Moshe says that this is to exclude human flesh&#8230; but the matter is not so, because the Sages explicitly permitted biped blood and biped milk, so there is not even a rabbinic commandment to separate from it. And if its meat were forbidden, what comes from something unclean is unclean, and the Sages excluded insect blood and human blood from the prohibition against blood, and they said &#8220;the blood of an insect is like its meat&#8221; and one is flogged for it on account of its insect-ness and not on account of its blood-ness, and they made it like meat. But what they said&#8212;that eating [human flesh] is not covered by the prohibition&#8212;is to say that they are not excluding it [from the list of permitted meats] and they are permitting it. But according to my opinion this is meat from someone alive, but regarding a corpse, we learn by a textual similarity from the law of the heifer whose neck is broken that we are forbidden to derive benefit from it. [Nachmanides s.v. Leviticus 11:3]</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Nachmanides makes the inference from Torat Cohanim that we were afraid to make earlier: if the prohibition against eating from non-kosher animals does not apply to human meat, then human meat must be permitted. <em>But</em> he points out that there is a completely separate commandment against deriving benefit from a human corpse. So if some poor fellow died to provide our deli plate, Nachmanides and Maimonides would forbid the meat, even though the Rosh would permit it. Meat &agrave; la Mike Tyson is kosher according to Nachmanides, even though both Maimonides and the Rosh forbid it. And <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/686/is-there-really-such-a-thing-as-placenta-stew">placenta stew</a> is OK according to both the Rosh and Nachmanides, even though Maimonides forbids it.</p>

	<p>How do we resolve this three-way split? There&#8217;s <a href="http://ropine.com/img/long-pig/d4.png">a very long Nimukei Yosef on Ketubot 60a</a>, evaluating all of the above interpretations, that is beyond my translation skills, although Gil Student might be summarizing it <a href="http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2007/05/cannibalism.html">here</a>. (He also brings down a fourth opinion, from the Ritva and the Re&#8217;ah: that since the Torah never explicitly permitted eating human meat, as it did for the meat of animals, it must be forbidden <em>and</em> punishable by flogging.)</p>

	<p>Rabbi Yosef Karo, curiously enough, does not address the question of human meat in either the Shulchan Aruch or its longer predecessor, the Beit Yosef. But the Rema, in his emendations, says:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><img src="http://ropine.com/img/long-pig/e1.png" style="float: left;" width="430" height="72" alt="scan from Shulchan Aruch [Hebrew]" /> Eating human flesh is forbidden by the Torah. [Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 79:1]</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The Shach, commenting on this line, says that if the meat comes from a live human it&#8217;s forbidden according to Maimonides&#8217; logic, and if it comes from a corpse then it&#8217;s forbidden according to Nachmanides.</p>

	<p>So the bottom line is: if you&#8217;re Ashkenazi, anthropophagy is strictly forbidden, although placenta stew might be less strictly forbidden than pork. If you&#8217;re Sephardi, consult your rabbi.</p>

The author explains that the new identity cards issued by China&#8217;s Public Security Bureau are rejecting many citizens&#8217; names because of their &#8220;obscure&#8221; characters because &#8220;[t]he bureau’s computers&#8230; are programmed to read only 32,252 of the roughly 55,000 Chinese characters&#8221;.</p>

	<p>Since 32,252 is suspiciously close to <a href="http://xkcd.com/571/">32,767</a>, I am wondering if the Bureau is stuck using an obsolete <del>31</del><ins>15</ins>-bit-wide character set. Perhaps someone from the technical press can follow up and ask the appropriate government officials: &#8220;what character set are you using?&#8221; and &#8220;why don&#8217;t you just use <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/unihan.html">Unicode</a>?”</p>

	<p>I should point out, in fairness, that my casual search didn&#8217;t locate the second character of Ma Cheng&#8217;s name in the Unihan database, so perhaps she would be out of luck even with a Unicode database.  Or maybe I just suck at recognizing Chinese characters.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>As you may have heard, there&#8217;s a massive&#8230;words fail me&#8230;going over the fannish segments of the Internet, particularly LiveJournal, that some have dubbed &#8220;RaceFail ’09&#8221;. (See <a href="http://rydra-wong.livejournal.com/tag/gcadod+09">here</a> for a chronological and comprehensive list of links. Note that despite the &#8220;Fail&#8221; in the topic as a whole, the content is a mix of the thought-provoking and the cringe-inducing.) I have been reading a lot of the stuff posted under this heading, commenting a little, reading a lot, commenting a little, reading a lot, thinking a lot&#8230; I think I&#8217;m ready to post a little now.</p>

	<p>Let me start by quoting Maimonides, <em>Laws of Repentance</em> 7:3.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Do not say that one should only repent of sins involving deeds, such as lechery and robbery and theft. Just as one has to turn away from these, so too does one have to search for bad character traits and turn away from them&#8212;from anger and from hatred and from envy and from strife and from mockery and from chasing money or honor and from gluttony, and so forth&#8212;from all of these, one must penitently return from. And these corruptions are harder than the ones involving deeds, because when one becomes embedded in them, it is hard to separate from them. And so it is written (Isaiah 55:7): &#8220;Let the evildoer abandon his way and the corrupt man his thoughts.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>A bad character trait is not a sin. (Maimonides uses different Hebrew words&#8212;<i>avonot</i> and <i>aveirot</i>&#8212;to refer to the two things.) People usually don&#8217;t <em>decide</em> to be angry or envious in the way they decide, say, to eat a cheeseburger. But Maimonides teaches us that no matter how those bad traits got into us, we have a duty to take them out, and he warns us that it&#8217;s not going to be easy.</p>

	<p>We might see the improvement of our own character as a form of prudence. Anger leads to assault, envy leads to theft, and so on, so if we control the roots of bad character we can prevent the weeds of overt sin from surfacing. We might even notice that bad character makes it harder to repent of our overt sins and easier to rationalize them.  (&#8220;OK, I hit her, but she deserved it, and I didn&#8217;t leave any bruises&#8230;&#8221;)</p>

	<p>Maimonides teaches us to go further. Even if we know with perfect certainty (as if we ever could) that our character flaws have not led us to <em>do</em> anything <em>wrong</em>, we still have to work on uprooting them. The flaws are bad in and of themselves, not just bad for what they do.</p>

	<p>Moreover, we have an obligation to <em>look for</em> those bad traits&#8212;to turn over the wet rocks in our own souls and see if anything slimy and ugly has made a home there. It&#8217;s not enough to leave them all untouched until someone else says &#8220;dude, I think you have some envy issues you need to work on&#8221;. It&#8217;s <em>certainly</em> not enough to wait for that &#8220;someone else&#8221; to phrase his or her critique in a given way.</p>

	<p>This is great news, because it means we will always have something to do. If God set a standard of human virtue and said &#8220;get up to here&#8221;, then anyone who reached that standard would have little motivation to go higher, and anyone who found that standard impossible would have little motivation to rise at all. But the commandment of repentance focuses on our direction, not our position.</p>

	<p>Almost all of us are tainted by the corruption of racial prejudice, but we can repent of it. I am a racist, <strong>but if I make the right effort today, I will be less of a racist tomorrow than I was yesterday</strong>. That&#8217;s a capability I can be proud of&#8230; if I use it.</p>

	<p>OK, back to reading a lot.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>This past Shabbat, as I was bundling children up to leave our synagogue, I overheard some other members grumbling about a mosque that was being established in the Boston area&#8212;I forget where.  To be precise, they were grumbling that some other folks were concerned about a Mormon center being established in the area, whereas we all <em>should be</em> concerned about the mosque; we should hope that the Mormons go and proseletyze the Muslims.</p>

	<p>My observation that Muslims, unlike Mormons, are strict monotheists only prompted a recitation of anti-Muslim talking points, and I regret that I could not think on my feet fast enough to give each one the answer it deserved.</p>

	<p>In particular, to the complaint that the Koran advocates violence against unbelievers, I should have said: &#8220;Today is Shabbat Zachor. Less than two hours ago, we heard in the Haftarah about how King Saul lost his dynasty because he didn&#8217;t obey God&#8217;s command to kill every man, woman, and child in the nation of Amalek. Aren&#8217;t we in a <em>really bad position</em> to be judging other religions based on the plain text of their holy books?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Also, in response to &#8220;would you want a Muslim living next door to you?&#8221; I should have said &#8220;Have neighbors who follow a religion requiring them to <em>abstain from alcohol</em>? I would bake them a frigging <em>cake</em>. If there&#8217;s some <em>hadith</em> that also forbids pissing off a balcony, I would bake them <em>two cakes</em>.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m sure I will have other opportunities to practice such responses in the future, though. Unfortunately.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I have read Rashid Khalidi&#8217;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Iron-Cage-Palestinian-Struggle-Statehood/dp/0807003085">The Iron Cage: The Story of the Palestinian Struggle for Statehood</a>, and I can thank John McCain for bringing his work to my attention.</p>

	<p>You see, back in the fall, the McCain crew tried to <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1225199601042&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">make hay</a> out of Obama&#8217;s alleged association with Khalidi, a former colleague of Obama&#8217;s at the University of Chicago. This led none other than Marty Peretz to <a href="http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_spine/archive/2008/10/30/excuse-me.aspx">protest</a>: &#8220;I assume that my Zionist credentials are not in dispute. And I have written more appreciative words about Khalidi than Obama ever uttered.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then, after Operation Cast Lead began, I decided I really needed to bone up on Middle Eastern history, and I remembered Khalidi&#8217;s name. I don&#8217;t expect <a href="http://www.camera.org/"><span class="caps">CAMERA</span></a> to quote <em>The Iron Cage</em> with authority, but Khalidi doesn&#8217;t romanticize the Palestinian side, either.  I don&#8217;t want to summarize or review the book here but I do want to riff, as it were, from one of the points the book makes.</p>

	<p>Khalidi writes about how, during the mandatory period, leaders of Palestinian communities appealed to the British, over and over, for representation in the Mandate&#8217;s political institutions. After all, President Woodrow Wilson had championed the &#8220;autonomous development&#8221; of ethnic groups previously ruled by the Ottoman Empire, and the Mandate was ostensibly for the purpose of fostering that development. The British response, over and over was: so sorry, chaps, but the Balfour Declaration says Palestine is supposed to be a Jewish national home, so if you want to be part of our administrative structures you need to accept the terms of the Declaration. This response left the Palestinians dissatisfied, to say the least.</p>

	<p>Reading this, I was reminded of two things.</p>

	<p>First, I was reminded of David Fromkin&#8217;s fantastic book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Peace-End-All-20th-Anniversary/dp/0805088091/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1236309125&amp;sr=8-2">A Peace To End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East</a>. Fromkin makes clear that while the British were very good at <em>talking about</em> self-determination of national groups&#8212;to curry favor with Wilson, to stir up Arabs against Ottoman rule, and to block French claims to Syria&#8212;they avoided <em>doing</em> it in the Middle Eastern territories they controlled, for a number of reasons:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Once the Ottoman Empire entered World War I, Britain was concerned about protecting its access to India. They could not countenance a rival power taking control of any country between Egypt and Persia, which meant that they did not want any state in that region to have enough autonomy to invite such a power in.</li>
		<li>Against Wilson&#8217;s principle of &#8220;autonomous development&#8221;, the British believed in the old-fashioned principle &#8220;to the victor go the spoils&#8221;, especially considering the vast blood and treasure they spent on overthrowing the Ottomans.</li>
		<li>They took for granted that the Arabs were incapable of self-government, and thought even less of the Palestinians than they did of other Arabs.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Second, I was reminded of a very common trope in European Jewish history: A king invites Jews to settle in his land, and allows some of them to interact with his subjects in necessary but distasteful jobs, e.g., moneylending and tax collection. When the subjects feel oppressed by their political or economic condition, animus against the actual ruling class can be redirected to a pogrom against the Jews.</p>

	<p>So from the perspective of a British colonialist in 1925-ish, the setup in Palestine must have looked perfect. Here was a land sitting in the middle of a crucial trade route, where the job of civil administration could be delegated to people who were <em>almost</em> white Christians. By holding up the land as a &#8220;Jewish national home&#8221;, Britain could keep those silly idealists in the Wilson Administration from asking why the majority ethnic group in the territory wasn&#8217;t being put in control. What could possibly go wrong?</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>At Thursday night&#8217;s banquet for the Conservative Political Action Conference, Representative Michele Bachman (R-Minn.), the emcee, was so moved by Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele that she told him: <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/02/27/steele-to-cpac-the-republican-party-is-just-fine/">“You be da man!”</a></p>

	<p>(Steele, of course, is <del>da</del> the man who was chosen for party chairmanship solely for his qualifications, and not at all because of <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0209/Steele_offers_Jindal_slum_love.html?showall">his African-American-ness</a>, because Republicans are all staunchly colorblind and would never demean a black man by making him think he might owe his job to affirmative action.)</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m glad to see that the Grand Old Party may give up on this whole politics thing and rebrand itself as a comedy troupe.  But someone really ought to give Rep.&nbsp;Bachman better lines.  <a href="http://ta-nehisicoates.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/02/distinguished_officials_for_proper_ebonics.php">The proper idiom</a> is &#8220;you da man&#8221;, not &#8220;you be da man&#8221;.

<![CDATA[<p>A short story of mine, &#8220;Very Truly Yours&#8221;, has been published in the (semi-pro) webzine <a href="http://www.polutexni.com/">Polu Texni</a>.  Seven thousand words is apparently a bit long for the Web, so they broke it into four parts: <a href="http://www.polutexni.com/?p=320">I</a> <a href="http://www.polutexni.com/?p=325">II</a> <a href="http://www.polutexni.com/?p=331"><span class="caps">III</span></a> <a href="http://www.polutexni.com/?p=337">IV</a>.</p>

	<p>After reading the first half of the story, Michael A. Burstein, an actual award-winning professional SF writer, said <a href="http://mabfan.livejournal.com/418900.html">“the idea behind the story is fascinating&#8230; the voice of the first person protagonist is compelling, and&#8230; I am now eager for Part <span class="caps">III</span> and the resolution”</a>.  I hope he is not disappointed.</p>

	<p>Thanks to Dawn Albright for publishing me, thanks to Michael for the kind words, and thanks to all the folks at the old Critical Mass writers&#8217; workshop for showing me where previous drafts of the story went wrong.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>This week, learning Gemara (Pesachim 112a), I learned:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Rabbi Akiva commanded his son, Rabbi Yehoshua, seven things. &#8220;My son:</p>
		<p>	<ol>
		<li>&#8220;Don&#8217;t sit and learn in the high part of the city.</li>
		<li>&#8220;And don&#8217;t live in a city whose leaders are Torah scholars.</li>
		<li>&#8220;And don&#8217;t enter your house suddenly [i.e. without announcing your presence]; all the more so your neighbor&#8217;s house.</li>
		<li>&#8220;And don&#8217;t go without shoes on your feet.</li>
		<li>&#8220;Eat early in the summer, before it gets hot, and in the winter, before it gets cold.</li>
		<li>&#8220;And make your Sabbath like a weekday rather than depending on other people.</li>
		<li>&#8220;And be on good terms with someone who is lucky.&#8221;</li>
	</ol></p>
		<p>Rav Pappa said [regarding that lucky man], &#8220;Don&#8217;t buy from him and don&#8217;t sell to him, but rather, enter into a partnership with him.&#8221; But since Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak said, &#8220;What is the meaning of &#8216;You have blessed the work of his hands&#8217; [Job 1:10]? Every one of Job&#8217;s dropped coins was blessed&#8221;, it&#8217;s OK to buy from him and sell to him.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>I asked my chevruta how his employer, <a href="http://www.shoebuy.com/">Shoebuy.com</a>, is doing. &#8220;Pretty good,&#8221; he said, &#8220;since all the Torah scholars are selling everything else they own so they can keep having shoes on their feet.&#8221; Should I buy <a href="http://www.shoebuy.com/teva-mens-sandals.htm">sandals</a> or <a href="http://www.iac.com/Our-Businesses/">stock</a>?</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>When discussion of an auto industry bailout began to circulate, some people pointed out, as evidence of the shameful sloth of its unionized work force, the United Auto Workers&#8217; <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/11/19/ap5717126.html">jobs bank</a>, in which employees continue to get 95 percent of their base pay and all their benefits if they are laid off. In the heyday of the program (before the most recent round of contract negotiations), the jobs bank cost GM <a href="http://tedmathis.blogspot.com/2008/11/uaw-and-its-billion-dollar-rubber-room.html">almost a billion dollars a year</a>, which is to say, slightly more than GM was paying out in dividends to its stockholders.</p>

	<p>Imagine that, paying people who aren&#8217;t doing any productive labor for your company! Any corporation that suffers such indolence does not deserve to suck at the federal teat. (And indeed, the <span class="caps">UAW</span> indicated that it would accept an end to the jobs bank program as one of the strings attached to a bailout.)</p>

	<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122878309173989913.html">By contrast, this is how real capitalists operate</a> &#8212; capitalists who have already received ten times what the Big Three are asking for, although <a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/12/bailout_oversight_too_little_t.php">God only knows what they&#8217;ve done with the money</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Inside what&#8217;s left of Wall Street, investment bankers are doing all they can to cope with a business that is disappearing before their eyes. Yes, there are tens of thousands of people still with jobs. They just don&#8217;t have much work. Debt and stock markets are virtually shut, merger volume is down by 28%, and whole lines of structured finance are closed for good&#8230;</p>
		<p>For now, the coping is taking the form of prolific meeting-taking. Ten of 11 people interviewed described, with unexpected eagerness, how now is a good time to &#8220;connect with clients&#8221; or &#8220;build relationships.&#8221; One boasted of spending just two days a month in the office, while another ex-J.P. Morgan employee boasted of two breakthrough meetings &#8212; just hours before he was fired.</p>
		<p>The bankers say that the most substantive conversations are, surprise, those with companies in urgent need of cash. These companies will listen to anyone who may have a creative idea or two. With markets frozen, there is little work to actually complete. &#8220;What&#8217;s your definition of business?&#8221; snapped one Merrill Lynch executive.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The article also mentions in passing that on the brave new Street, &#8220;a $700,000 salary is deemed generous&#8221;.  O the humanity.</p>

	<p>(Disclaimer of vested interest: We drive a 1999 Ford Windstar minivan which truly lives up to the motto &#8220;Fix Or Replace Daily&#8221;. And when we finally replace it, we&#8217;re not going to the Big Three.)</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Rod Blagojevich, the recently-arrested Governor of Illinois, may be <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/247380.php">“not as bright” as George W. Bush</a>, but if Ali Ata&#8217;s testimony is to be believed, even Blagojevich knows <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/10illinois_complaint.pdf">how to take a bribe</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>[¶21] &#8230;After he arrived at Rezko’s offices, Ata was greeted by Rezko to whom he handed the check in an envelope. Rezko, carrying the check, ushered Ata into a conference room where he met with Rezko and <span class="caps">ROD</span> <span class="caps">BLAGOJEVICH</span>.

	<p>I hope that future corrupt politicians will follow the example of Governor Blagojevich and the legions of respectable graft-seekers who preceded him, instead of crassly <a href="http://bostonist.com/2008/10/28/wilkerson_brastuffing_photo_of_the.php">stuffing greenbacks into their undergarments</a>. </p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Imagine a country with a big chunk of disputed territory on its border, a developing economy, and a state-sponsored religion.  The inhabitants of this country, a quarrelsome lot, divide into three factions:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>40 percent of the population are <strong>Wolves</strong>; they have, as their highest priority, attracting foreign investment. To the extent consistent with that first goal, they are willing to take a hard-line stance on territorial issues. They would rather weaken the state religious bodies than strengthen them.</li>
		<li>35 percent of the population are <strong>Hawks</strong>, and are hard-liners on territory first. They are also willing to increase the power of the state religion. Attracting foreign investment is really not on their agenda.</li>
		<li>25 percent of the population are <strong>Lions</strong>, who are most concerned with bringing the country closer to a theocracy.  Their second interest is attracting foreign investment.  Territorial issues come last.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This is what we in the poli-sci world called &#8220;circular preference&#8221;.  If our hypothetical country is democratically run, which faction will seize <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOOTKA0aGI0">the supreme executive power which derives from a mandate from the masses</a>? That all depends on what kind of democracy it has, and how cynical the politicians are.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>If the head of government is elected in a &#8220;first-past-the-post&#8221; system, where you just need a plurality to win, then the Wolves are favored to win. Certainly, any party with the Lions&#8217; agenda will be a perpetual loser, so Lions will be supplicants to the Wolf- and Hawk-dominated parties; the leaders of those parties will have to try to figure out how to attract Lion votes in a way that does not alienate their primary constituents.</li>
		<li>If elections require an absolute majority to win, and a runoff election in the event that nobody gets an absolute majority, then the Wolves are in a strong position, but a Wolf who <em>really</em> wants to attract foreign investment may vote for the Lion candidate in the first round of balloting, in the hope that the runoff election is Wolf vs. Lion rather than Wolf vs. Hawk.</li>
		<li>If the country has a legislature elected by proportional representation, and that legislature elects the head of government, then the Lions are no longer supplicants, but kingmakers.</li>
		<li>If the country&#8217;s head of government is appointed by the head of state, and the legislature has to pass a vote of no confidence to dissolve the government, then the Wolves, once again, are favored; the Wolf executive just needs to keep playing the Lions and Wolves off against each other well enough to keep them both from forming a coalition.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>As you can see, once there are three parties (or three powerful political factions), any system of &#8220;democratic&#8221; decision-making has to put scare quotes around &#8220;democratic&#8221;, because the outcome of the decision-making process really depends on the particular &#8220;rules of the game&#8221; and how well the players can manipulate the rules. This insight was formalized by Kenneth Arrow in his famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow&#39;s_impossibility_theorem">dictator theorem</a>.</p>

	<p>As Hegel said, tragedy is not right against wrong, but right against right.  Or perhaps, in this case, right against right against right.</p>

	<p>It may be obvious at this point that the country foremost in my mind as I compose this posting is not Israel, but <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2206040/">Canada</a>. Perhaps it&#8217;s not such a bad thing to have a constitution where, if the normal operations of democratic institutions fail, the system falls back, as it were, to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Canadian_parliamentary_dispute">monarchy</a>.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p><span class="caps">HTML</span> has a little-used element, <code>&lt;col&gt;</code>, that can be used to describe attributes for a table column. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#h-11.3.2">The <span class="caps">HTML</span> 4.01 spec</a> gives an example (which I have reformatted because I can&#8217;t stand the <span class="caps">ALL</span> <span class="caps">CAPS</span> <span class="caps">ELEMENT</span> <span class="caps">NAMES</span>) of using this element to declare that text in a certain column should be aligned on the decimal point:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;colgroup&gt;
    &lt;col&gt;&lt;col align=&quot;char&quot; char=&quot;.&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Vegetable &lt;th&gt;Cost per kilo
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Lettuce        &lt;td&gt;$1
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Silver carrots &lt;td&gt;$10.50
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Golden turnips &lt;td&gt;$100.30
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

	<p>Allegedly, such a table will be laid out like this:</p>

<pre><code>------------------------------
|   Vegetable  |Cost per kilo|
|--------------|-------------|
|Lettuce       |        $1   |
|--------------|-------------|
|Silver carrots|       $10.50|
|--------------|-------------|
|Golden turnips|      $100.30|
------------------------------
</code></pre>

	<p><a href="http://ropine.com/col/align-1.html">Except it isn&#8217;t.</a></p>

	<p>Apparently, in this respect, <span class="caps">HTML</span> 4.01 has been superceded by <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#columns"><span class="caps">CSS</span> 2.1</a>, which states that the only properties you can apply to a column are those dealing with the border, the background, the cell width, and the visibility of &#8220;collapse&#8221;.  (&#8220;But wait!&#8221; I hear you cry. &#8220;There&#8217;s no <span class="caps">CSS</span> in that table&#8230;&#8221;)</p>

	<p>So if you want to declare the alignment of a column and you don&#8217;t want to put an explicit <code>class</code> or <code>style</code> marker on every cell of that column, you have to either use Javascript or fool around with the more esoteric corners of <span class="caps">CSS</span>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
td:last-child { text-align: right }
.hide { visibility: hidden }
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

	<p>&#8230;yielding <a href="http://ropine.com/col/align-2.html">this page</a>, which doesn&#8217;t work for Internet Explorer, because not even IE8 supports the <code>:last-child</code> selector. Oh, and I don&#8217;t see how to align on a decimal point using <span class="caps">CSS</span>&#8212;a CSS3 draft proposed “<code>text-align: '.'</code>” but nobody bothered implementing it&#8212;so I used that <code>hide</code> class to cheat; you can &#8220;view source&#8221; on that page to see how.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn17858407184938b5487b05f">1</a></sup></p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t know who is responsible for this suppression of useful features from the Web.  I suspect some conspiracy involving the Trilateral Commission and the Bilderberg Group.</p>

	<p><strong>PS:</strong> <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2008/12/square-is-new-round.html">I take it</a> that boxes with rounded corners are No Longer Even A Little Bit Cool. Maybe in three years they&#8217;ll become charmingly retro.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I do not have any fundamental objections to any of these newfangled reproductive technologies: <span class="caps">IVF</span>, surrogate parenthood, cloning, male pregnancy, whatever. Bring ’em on.  And I think progressive income taxes are better for society than sumptuary laws, which is to say, there&#8217;s nothing fundamentally wrong with being rich and there&#8217;s nothing fundamentally wrong with rich people buying things that regular folks can&#8217;t afford.</p>

	<p><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/11/30/magazine/30surrogate-395.jpg" style="float: right;" title="Cathy Hilling, surrogate mother, and Alex Kuczynski, genomom and journalist." alt="Cathy Hilling, surrogate mother, and Alex Kuczynski, genomom and journalist." /></p>

	<p>But I was still squicked by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/magazine/30Surrogate-t.html?_r=1">this article on a woman whose fertilized egg was carried in another woman&#8217;s uterus</a>, starting with the layout of the magazine cover. While Cathy Hilling, the surrogate mother, stands in flats, Alex Kuczynski, producer of the lucky egg, stands in high heels <em>and</em> upstage <em>and</em> with her hair up. It seems that the <i>Times</i>’s art director wanted to portray the two women bonded at the hip, but also wanted to show clearly who is in charge.</p>

	<p>Deep in the text of the article, things get squickier:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>No money ever changes hands directly between the intended parents (I.P.’s in surrogacy speak) and the surrogate. All the money goes into an escrow account set up by Brisman’s office, and a third party pays out the monthly fees. I.P.’s and surrogates are discouraged from discussing money. This is partly to remove the air of commercialism from the proceedings.</p>
		<p>Shortly after our meeting, Brisman’s office started to send us profiles of potential surrogates. It felt strangely like getting a letter from the roommate who would be sharing your dorm room freshman year. They described themselves, their lives, their ambitions&#8230;.</p>
		<p>While no one volunteering to have our baby was poor, neither were they rich. The $25,000 we would pay would make a significant difference in their lives. Still, in our experience with the surrogacy industry, no one lingered on the topic of money. We encountered the wink-nod rule: Surrogates would never say they were motivated to carry a child for another couple just for money; they were all motivated by altruism. This gentle hypocrisy allows surrogacy to take place. Without it, both sides would have to acknowledge the deep cultural revulsion against attaching a dollar figure to the creation of a human life.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>I&#8217;m sure that when Hilling&#8217;s obstetrician negotiates with an insurance company over reimbursement rates, nobody has any qualms about &#8220;attaching a dollar figure to the creation of a human life&#8221;. And the insurance company doesn&#8217;t give a damn about the obstetrician&#8217;s life or ambitions.</p>

	<p>In a relationship between a contractor and her client, where money is discussed frankly and changes hands shamelessly, there can be mutual respect. <i>I have something you want; you have a skill I need; let&#8217;s discuss an arrangement that benefits us both.</i> Between two people who are related by blood or marriage, there can also be mutual respect. <i>I want you to do me a favor because we are in a bond of mutual obligation, and I understand that some day you may ask the same of me.</i> Hilling petitions for her assignment like a suitor, accepts Kuczynski&#8217;s money like a contractor, and then hangs out with her (playing Kuczynski&#8217;s piano, giving her a gift) like a relative. So what is their relationship? Ten years from now, if, God forbid, Hilling is abused by her husband or develops a drug habit, how far will Kuczynski et al. go to help out? Now that her skill as a gestator has been praised by the national newspaper of record, can Hilling demand $30,000 from the next aspiring mother? I fear that surrogates, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nanny-Diaries-Novel-Emma-Mclaughlin/dp/0312291639">nannies</a>, are ending up with the duties of both statuses and the privileges of neither.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Back in the 1980s, there was a heated debate among Democratic partisans regarding how the party could regain its lost power. The argument centered around one annoying fact: members of demographic groups that favor Democrats do not vote in proportion to their numbers. One group of Democrats argued that the party should therefore intensify its registration and get-out-the-vote drives among those groups, and retake the White House without significantly changing the party platform&#8212;indeed, some of these Democrats said, the party should give those voters more motivation to go to the polls by taking stances farther to the left. Another group argued that the party was already doing all it could to get its traditional interest groups to the polls, and that in order to have a future, Democrats needed to move closer to the (new?) political center, in order to win back white working- and middle-class voters who had defected to the Republicans.</p>

	<p>Now we have a Democratic president-elect who (for the first time since 1976) won with a <em>majority</em> of the popular vote rather than a plurality, <a href="http://voteview.ucsd.edu/Clinton_and_Obama.htm">whose voting record puts him in the middle of the Democratic party</a>, and <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/contact-gap-proof-of-importance-of.html">who ran a very thorough voter outreach operation</a>. So I thought it might be worthwhile to review a few rounds of exit polls.  In the tables below, <strong>%v</strong> indicates what percentage of votes were cast by each group in the given Presidential election, and <strong>%d</strong> indicates what percentage of that group&#8217;s voters cast their votes for the Democrat. The &#8220;non-Xian&#8221; row combines the exit pollsters&#8217; information for people whose religion is Jewish, &#8220;other&#8221;, or &#8220;none&#8221;.</p>

	<p>Lots to discuss there, but I&#8217;m going to go to bed rather than draw out conclusions myself right now.</p>

	<p>However, I do observe that the Republicans are now having their own post-crushing-defeat argument between centrists and, umm, not-so-centrists, and <a href="http://www.democracycorps.com/strategy/2008/10/the-republican-disconnect/">so far the not-so-centrists dominate the party</a>.  Lotsa luck, guys.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Let me just post my quick reactions before I find out what everyone else in the world has been saying about this debate for the past 27 hours.</p>

	<p>I think for both Obama and McCain, the debates are their best opportunity to refute the negative images that their opponents have attached to them over the past nine months.  So Obama had to demonstrate that he&#8217;s not just an empty suit, and McCain had to untie Bush and the Republican Party from around his neck. In this respect, I think Obama did fairly well by talking of specific policy proposals and by referring to work he had done in the Senate. McCain was clearly taking every opportunity to distance himself from his party, but the issues where he made the distinction were matters of foreign policy, e.g., supporting Clinton&#8217;s war in the Balkans.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately for McCain, (a)&nbsp;most voters in this election cycle are going to care more about the economy than on foreign affairs, and (b)&nbsp;on the one foreign-policy issue that people care most about, the Iraq war, more people are likely to agree with Obama than with McCain. (As far as I can recall, McCain dared not claim, during the debate, that invading Iraq was a good idea in the first place. It was all surge, surge, surge.)</p>

	<p>If I had to score the debate on points, I would therefore give Obama an edge, but not a decisive victory. If Obama were five points behind in the tracking polls, rather than five points ahead, I would be very very nervous.</p>

	<p>As they say, a week is a long time in politics. But we&#8217;re running out of weeks.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p><a href="http://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/betamax/">Sony v. Universal</a>, also known as the &#8220;Betamax case&#8221;, is a bit of legal history so beloved of geeks, passed on from grizzled hacker to Slashdot newbie, that it deserves the title of &#8220;myth&#8221;.</p>

	<p>The story goes like this: Once upon a time, an innovative consumer-electronics company called Sony invented a wonderful machine called the Betamax, which could record TV shows on tape. Then a big mean entertainment conglomerate called Universal sued them, saying that people could use the Betamax to break copyright laws and it was Sony&#8217;s fault. Universal sued Sony over and over and over again, until finally the United States Supreme Court gave Sony a pat on the head and a big hug and said they hadn&#8217;t done anything wrong. And in the years that followed, Universal earned millions and millions of dollars by selling its movies and TV shows on tapes that could be played in Sony&#8217;s machines. The moral of this story is that innovative content-liberating technology is good for everyone, even big mean entertainment conglomerates.</p>

	<p>There is, however, a small detail of history that didn&#8217;t make it into the myth.</p>

	<p>At the same time that Sony was developing the Betamax, Universal&#8217;s parent company, <span class="caps">MCA</span>, was developing a playback-only video medium, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaserDisc">laserdisc</a>. <span class="caps">MCA</span> wanted to partner with Sony on developing laserdisc playback machines <em>and</em> convince Sony to discontinue the Betamax. So, in September 1976, top executives of <span class="caps">MCA</span> and Sony met to discuss videodisk development. At the very end of their discussion, the president of <span class="caps">MCA</span> and Universal threatened to sue Sony if the Betamax were not discontinued or modified. Akio Morita, steeped in the Japanese way of doing business, was certain that <span class="caps">MCA</span> would not follow through on its threat; as he told a colleague, &#8220;friends don&#8217;t sue&#8221;. Except, of course, they did.</p>

	<p>If Universal&#8217;s negotiators had been savvy enough to shut down the videocassette industry without suing, or if they had swayed one more Supreme Court justice, then they <em>still</em> would be collecting millions and millions of dollars from home video sales. They just would have been comforted knowing that their customers&#8217; home video equipment used a non-recordable medium.</p>

	<p>The moral of this story is that big mean entertainment conglomerates are not always as dumb as they look.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The Talmud records the following deep philosophical debate:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>For two and a half years, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel had an argument.  These said: It would have been better if man had not been created.  These said: It is better that man has been created.  They put it to a vote and decided: It would have been better if man had not been created, but now that he has been created, let him examine his deeds.</p><p class="via">Eruvin 13b</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>This passage, I assume, is the inspiration for a classic Jewish joke:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>It would be better never to have been born. But who among us has such luck? One in a thousand, perhaps.</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p><i>Ki Tetze</i>, the parsha that was read in shul this morning, is our aufruf parsha, and I think it&#8217;s the best aufruf parsha <span class="caps">EVAR</span>, because it talks about just about everything that could go wrong with a marriage. There&#8217;s the beautiful woman captured in wartime, there&#8217;s the man who hates one of his two wives, there&#8217;s the stubborn and rebellious son, etc., etc., etc&#8230; and there&#8217;s divorce. Which is what I want to talk about. It&#8217;s OK. I&#8217;m not about to deliver bad news.</p>

	<p>In the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tikkun-Olam-Responsibility-Thought-Orthodox/dp/0765759519">Tikkun Olam</a> anthology, Rabbi Michael J.&nbsp;Broyde has an essay in which he asks: should Jews, through persuasion and/or the political process, encourage non-Jews to be more observant of the <a href="http://www.asknoah.org/">seven Noachide commandments</a>? One problem with such a project, he points out, is that we&#8217;re often not sure what those commandments entail. As a specific example, he cited a three-way controversy over the law of Noachide divorce. The rest of this post is basically the result of my chasing down Rabbi Broyde&#8217;s footnotes, with some help from <a href="http://www.kadimahtorasmoshe.org/bin/view/Ktm/RabbiAzrielBlumberg">my local Orthodox halakhic authority</a> and <a href="http://besamim.livejournal.com/">besamim</a>.</p>

	<h1>Before we can have divorce, we must have marriage</h1>

	<p>The Mishnah (Kiddushin 1:1) summarizes the ways that a woman can be married (through money, document, or sexual relations) and unmarried (through death and divorce). Surprisingly, while the plain text of this week&#8217;s parsha says a lot about divorce, it doesn&#8217;t say very much about marriage itself; when the Gemara looks for sources in the Torah to justify the Mishnah&#8217;s rules about how to get married, it relies heavily on indirect arguments from other verses. I would suggest that we can understand this asymmetry by looking at the Torah&#8217;s original audience. It&#8217;s safe to assume that when they arrived at Mt.&nbsp;Sinai, Jews were familiar with the laws of Noachide marriage, or at least, they had a traditional family law that was consistent with the laws of Noachide marriage. Therefore, the plain text of the Torah focused on what aspects of the law were new to them, rather than what was continuous with the old law.</p>

	<p>The Jerusalem Talmud (Kiddushin 1:1) derives laws of Noachide marriage from Genesis 2:24&#8212;&#8220;therefore a man should leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife&#8221;. Rabbi Mana expounds on this verse that a man should cleave to <em>his</em> wife, and not to <em>his neighbor&#8217;s</em> wife. The Yerushalmi also declares that non-Jews do not have <em>kiddushin</em>, the first stage of Jewish marriage. Regarding <em>gerushin</em>, divorce, it says that either non-Jews do not have any divorce or they divorce one another (&#8220;או שאין להן גירושין או ששניהן מגרשין זה את זה&#8221;). Furthermore, the Yerushalmi cites Deuteronomy 24:1&ndash;4 (see above) and says because this passage concludes by mentioning &#8220;the land that the Eternal your God gives you as an inheritance&#8221;, it does not apply to Noachides. But there are so many laws packed into those four verses that it&#8217;s not clear what it means to negate them.</p>

	<h1>The matriarchal interpretation</h1>

	<p>Bereshit Rabba 18:5 covers much of the same ground as the Yerushalmi, and adds an opinion by Rabbi Yochanan: the <em>wife</em> divorces the <em>husband</em>, and gives him a דופורון (which, according to Jastrow&#8217;s dictionary, is a mistransliteration of the Latin <em>repudium</em>, the bill of divorce that the Romans used). Rashi unpacks Rabbi Yochanan&#8217;s logic as follows: since under Genesis 2:24 the husband is obliged to cleave to his wife, he can&#8217;t &#8220;uncleave&#8221; her by divorcing her. But since the wife has no corresponding obligation to her husband, she is free to send him away.</p>

	<h1>The no-fault interpretation</h1>

	<p>Maimonides, in the Mishnah Torah, states that before the Torah was given a man could simply marry a woman by taking her home and having relations with her (Ishut 1:1); for a man&#8217;s wife to become &#8220;like one of our divorc&eacute;es&#8221;, she just had to stop living in his household, or alternatively, he could send her away. It&#8217;s interesting to note that when he talks about these laws, Maimonides, is careful <em>not</em> to use the Hebrew words <em>kiddushin</em> or <em>gerushin</em> to describe transactions between non-Jews, even in the &#8220;they divorce each other&#8221; sense that the Yerushalmi and Bereshit Rabba use. I haven&#8217;t studied this stuff in any depth, but note that for Jews, once a man and a woman enter <em>kiddushin</em> (e.g., he gives her a ring and says the magic words), even if they have not yet had <em>chuppah</em>, their relationship can only be dissolved with death or a <em>get</em>. So I would speculate that for Maimonides, <em>kiddushin</em> and <em>gerushin</em> come as a matched set; if you lose one, you have to lose the other, and without the change of legal status that these two actions generate, you&#8217;re left with mere cohabitation.</p>

	<h1>The more-than-Catholic interpretation</h1>

	<p>The Pnei Yehoshua, an early-18th-century German rabbi, offers a third interpretation. In the Bablyonian Talmud (Kiddushin 13b), there is an argument over how we know that a woman becomes free to remarry after her husband dies. Various proof-texts are brought and rejected; the one that sticks is Deuteronomy 24:3. The Gemara concludes that since that verse connects a husband&#8217;s divorce and his death, we can say that just as divorce frees a woman from her husband, so does the husband&#8217;s death. But wait! says the Pnei Yehoshua. We know from the Yerushalmi that this whole passage only applies to Jews. <em>Therefore</em>, the rule that a woman is freed by her husband&#8217;s death <em>also</em> only applies to Jews; Noachide women must remain in their marital state even after their husbands die.</p>

	<h1>Practical consequences for the reader</h1>

	<p>So, if you have a non-Jewish friend who approaches you for advice, because he or she is in an unhappy marriage and has moral reservations about how best to proceed&#8230; and this person thinks that since you are a righteous and caring individual, you might be able to counsel them about the most appropriate course of action to take&#8230; don&#8217;t nominate any of these worthy authorities to serve as your friend&#8217;s moral compass. Instead, you should take the position of the Ragamam (haRabbanit haGaonit Miss Manners) and just not say anything.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I guess I have to say something about McCain&#8217;s speech now, too.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>In the biopic preceding the speech, the narrator told the story of a massive and deadly fire aboard the <i><span class="caps">USS</span> Forrestal</i> caused by an accidental missile launch. Somehow, the narrator declared, McCain survived.  Perhaps, the narrator declared, <em>it was because he had more work to be done</em>. And the <em>Republicans</em> accuse <em>Democrats</em> of setting Obama up as a Messiah-figure? I am rubber and you are glue&#8230;</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Did you know that McCain used to be a <span class="caps">POW</span>? And that he was in hell? And in a box for five years? And that he was dumped in a cell? And that he was a prisoner in another country? I&#8217;m impressed by how the biopic author and the speechwriter were able to <a href="http://www.peltorro.com/thesaurus.htm">rephrase the same concept</a> in so many different ways to fill up so many minutes. We saw and heard in vivid detail about McCain&#8217;s capture, his imprisonment, his endurance, and how it made him grow as a person.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Not so much detail, though, on what he&#8217;s going to do if he&#8217;s elected. There was the standard Republican wish list: lower taxes, lower spending, school &#8220;choice&#8221;, and &#8220;culture of life&#8221;. There was a list of things that probably appeal to many voters but seem incompatible with lower spending: job training for people whose jobs have gone overseas, more pay for good teachers, and every alternative-energy source that Obama supports.  (Plus, of course, &#8220;drill now&#8221;.  I think &#8220;drill now&#8221; got as much applause as &#8220;culture of life&#8221;. Remember, ladies, if you abort that fetus, you deprive your country of a future offshore-drilling-rig technician.)</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Before delivering that standard Republican wish list, McCain insisted that he&#8217;s <em>different</em> from all those Republicans who have been corrupted by &#8220;Washington&#8221;. He&#8217;s a &#8220;maverick&#8221;.  But he provided even less detail about what, exactly, he has done to distinguish himself from those <em>bad</em> Republicans. For example, he took credit for fighting &#8220;big spenders in both parties&#8221; without identifying any big expense that he fought against. Given McCain&#8217;s recent return to Republican orthodoxy, his boast deserves to be compared against his recent record.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Oh, and McCain demonstrated his bipartisanality by saying &#8220;Instead of rejecting good ideas because we didn&#8217;t think of them first, let&#8217;s use the best ideas from both sides.&#8221; Did he name a good idea that came from the Democratic side? (Say, &#8220;nominate a woman for the vice-presidential position&#8221;?) Of course not.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>&#8220;I fight for Bill and Sue Nebe from Farmington Hills, Michigan, who lost their real estate investments in the bad housing market.&#8221;  See, Democrats fight for people who lost their <em>homes</em>. Republicans fight for people who lost their <em>real estate investments</em>.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The paragraphs about Iraq, the surge, and Georgia seem to be repeats of earlier press releases and I can&#8217;t think of anything to say about them other than &#8220;yadda yadda yadda&#8221;.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>George W. Bush was not mentioned by name, only by title.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>McCain&#8217;s tone was folksy and mellow. I fear that in the swing states, that tone will get more attention than the content.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This week&#8217;s sleep deficit has been brought to you by the Republican National Convention.  Maybe next time I should liveblog, just like the pros.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a long and linky post about Governor Palin that I&#8217;ve been wanting to compose, but last night, instead of writing that, I watched the Giuliani and Palin speeches.  I know I&#8217;m not the intended audience for these things, but here are my reactions:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Do we now have a <em>bipartisan consensus</em> that it&#8217;s shameful to criticize a mother of young children who works outside the home? (Pause for raucous laughter.)</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Both Giuliani and Palin pronounced &#8220;community organizer&#8221; with the tone of contempt that Republicans usually reserve for &#8220;trial attorney&#8221;, &#8220;American Civil Liberties Union&#8221;, or &#8220;French&#8221;. As <a href="http://osewalrus.livejournal.com/362497.html">osewalrus</a> puts it: &#8220;because getting a large group of fractious people motivated and organized around a common goal on a non-existent budget is work for pussies, right?&#8221;</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Quoth Palin: &#8220;Before I became governor of the great state of Alaska, I was mayor of my hometown. And since our opponents in this presidential election seem to look down on that experience, let me explain to them what the job involved. I guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a community organizer, except that you have actual responsibilities.&#8221; But she never told the crowd <em>what</em> her responsibilities as mayor <em>were</em>&#8230; perhaps because in her case, they included raising the city sales tax, hiring a DC lobbyist to get pork from the Federal government, and putting the city over $18&nbsp;million in debt.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>I bet a lot of people watching the speech on TV wondered why &#8220;Styrofoam Greek columns&#8221; was an applause line. It&#8217;s the sort of insider reference that alienates the outsiders.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>A prime-time convention speech is an opportunity to appeal to swing voters. If I had been Palin&#8217;s speechwriter, I would have scoured her biography for specific examples of her reformist actions and padded that into a half-hour &#8220;Mrs.&nbsp;Smith Goes To Juneau&#8221; story that she could tell the cameras. They could  always save the red-meat attacks for the time slots where independent voters are less likely to be watching, and of course the folks in the stadium would have cheered enthusiastically for Palin reading the phone book. So why didn&#8217;t they take that route? Is her record really that thin? Is the campaign staff too unfamiliar with her record to compose such a speech? Does McCain need to energize his base that desperately?</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Instead, we had some fire-breathing speeches that, <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/09/great-speech-for-both-bases.html">as Sean of FiveThirtyEight.com pointed out</a>, will motivate <em>Democrats</em> to work their asses off.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Both speeches rehashed the attacks on Obama that the Clinton and McCain campaigns have been running all year. If those arguments haven&#8217;t pulled McCain to a decisive victory in the polls yet, why should they do it now? Contrast that with Obama&#8217;s acceptance speech, where he counteracted the image of himself as an empty suit by talking fluently about specific policies.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>I think the crowd&#8217;s reaction to Palin should kill off any speculation that she&#8217;ll be bumped off the ticket.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Moments after the speech ended, <span class="caps">NBC</span>&#8217;s announcer reported that when Palin boasted of turning down the &#8220;Bridge to Nowhere&#8221; earmark, she had been, shall we say, not entirely accurate. I don&#8217;t know how many people heard the fact-check over the crowd noise, but congratulations, <span class="caps">NBC</span>, for that moment of actual journalism.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>PS: The Obama campaign&#8217;s fact-check of Palin&#8217;s speech has been reposted <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/campaign_2008_/2008/09/palin_v_reality.php">here</a>.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>The second part of the <em>Boston Globe</em>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2007/08/19/freeing_up_deborah/">series on a Somerville doctor who got a male-to-female sex change</a> begins thusly:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>At age 52, Deborah Bershel made her first trip to the mall. It lasted nine hours. It was July 2006, and there was barely a rack of clothes in the Burlington Mall that she didn&#8217;t comb through. The next day she headed to the Natick Mall and logged another five hours shopping. She was making up for lost time. In each store, her approach was usually the same. She&#8217;d march up to a salesclerk and explain, &#8220;I&#8217;m a transsexual, so I&#8217;m new to this.&#8221; Then she&#8217;d ask her particular question, whether it be which cut of jeans would cover the top of her panties or which type of fabrics wouldn&#8217;t cling to her arms. &#8220;I have questions that no 50-year-old woman should have,&#8221; she said.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>My wife inferred from this anecdote that Bershel had no female friends, because otherwise, she would be asking those friends for advice, not sales clerks. Women, she said, shop in groups as a social activity; men shop for the purpose of getting something. (The standard &#8220;all generalizations are false&#8221; disclaimer applies.)</p>
	<p>I suggested that she put that observation in her LJ, but she asked me to put it here, since it connects with <a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/yesh/article/the-pink-and-blue-highlighters-in-your-brain">my previous comments regarding transwomen and platonic female friendship</a>. </p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p><em>Ha`aretz</em>, covering <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/890519.html">the eviction of some Jewish families from an illegal settlement in Hebron</a>, quoted Gershon Bar-Kochba, one of the residents who tried to resist eviction. The name also appeared in <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2D6103CF936A35757C0A96F948260">this <em>New York Times</em> article from 1989</a>: &#8220;Gershon Bar Kochba, a seminary student from Hebron, was suspected of leading a group who opened fire on Palestinians in Hebron&#8230;&#8221;  And <a href="http://www.hebron.com/english/article.php?id=301">this article on the Hebron Jewish community&#8217;s Web site</a> laments that Gershon Bar-Kochba had to post a 25,000-shekel<sup><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn105549494346ba79063c9a5">1</a></sup> bond in order to bail out a 14-year-old settler, while Arab suspects were routinely released on their own recognizance<sup><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn116650476746ba79063d174">2</a></sup>. </p>
	<p>OK, this guy appears to be something of a <em>macher</em> in Hebron.  What astounds me is that he carries the name of <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/revolt1.html">the leader of the last Jewish revolt against the Roman Empire</a>. That revolt was thoroughly crushed by the Romans, after which all the remaining Jews were exiled from Judea, the province was renamed &#8220;Syria Palestina&#8221;, many Jewish practices (such as Torah study and Shabbat) were prohibited, and many rabbis were martyred. What kind of yeshiva bocher treats a guy like this as a <em>role model</em>? Does he learn from some Bizzarro-Talmud in which it says that God destroyed our Temple and exiled us from our homeland because we were insufficiently ruthless to our enemies?</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn116650476746ba79063d174"><sup>2</sup> The article presented this as one example of how the Israeli government was treating Jewish settlers in Hebron more harshly than the Arabs. I mentioned this to my wife, and she said, &#8220;Well, they should. God Himself does.&#8221; After all, she went on, the Moslems only have the seven Noachide commandments to observe, while we have 613&#8230;of course, we can&#8217;t observe all of them today&#8230;and one of the reason we can&#8217;t observe all of them today is the misguided zealotry of Jews like the original Bar-Kochba.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Several folks on my LJ friends list have mentioned <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/magazine/22yeshiva-t.html?ex=1342756800&#38;en=4c8b6294d973a829&#38;ei=5090&#38;partner=rssuserland&#38;emc=rss">this charming piece</a>, in which Noah Feldman, a <a href="http://www.maimonides.org/">Maimonides School</a> alumnus, reflects on his school experience and the &#8220;Modern Orthodox&#8221; community surrounding it.  I put scare quotes around &#8220;Modern Orthodox&#8221; because while he attributes certain attitudes to people he calls &#8220;Modern Orthodox&#8221;, and perhaps those people would call <em>themselves</em> &#8220;Modern Orthodox&#8221;, he does not mention the long string of Jewish thinkers, starting with Rabbi Samson Rafael Hirsch זצ״ל, who <em>defined</em> Modern Orthodox Judaism. Feldman refers to Senator Joe Lieberman; he refers to Rabbi Moshe Feinstein זצ״ל; he refers to Yigal Amir and Baruch Goldstein. But he never cites the life or works of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik זצ״ל, the pre-eminent Modern Orthodox philosopher of the 20th century, who <em>founded of the Maimonides School</em> and who <em>was still alive while Feldman was a student there</em>. That should tell you something about the lens through which Feldman sees the Orthodox world.</p>
	<p>Feldman seems to believe that the most authentic expressions of Judaism are the most illiberal ones. Now, if <em>I</em> believed that, I would either join the charedi world, or I would never set foot in a synagogue again. But Feldman is married to a non-Jewish woman <em>and</em> takes his children to hear the Book of Esther read on Purim. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t everyone&#8217;s life a mass of contradictions?&#8221; he says.</p>
	<p>The &#8220;Modern Orthodox&#8221; community offends Feldman because instead of letting us all bask in postmodern &#8220;I am large, I contain multitudes&#8221; playfulness, it tries to <em>resolve</em> the contradictions. At Maimonides, learning the theory of evolution is OK, but marrying a non-Jew is not OK. The Maimonides approach is certainly open to critique. Different schools of Jewish thought (charedi Orthodox, classical Reform, etc.) can argue for different approaches to being a Jew in the 21st century. But Feldman does not have a school of thought; he has emotions that he treats as entitlements. It is not enough for him to marry a non-Jew and continue to feel connected with his Jewish upbringing; he wants his Orthodox alma mater to endorse his marriage. And so he does not <em>argue</em>; he <em>insinuates</em> that there is something false about Modern Orthodoxy, that instead of teaching Jews a way of <em>engaging</em> with the modern world, it teaches Jews to <em>disguise themselves</em> for the sake of getting along in that world.</p>
	<p>Feh.</p>
	<p>It&#8217;s bad enough that the most reactionary elements of the Jewish world have appointed themselves the final arbiters of my religion and have declared that my own community&#8217;s practice is, at best, Frumkeit Lite. But why do people with no interest in accepting &#8220;the yoke of the commandments&#8221; give the reactionaries the same license?</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Thanks to <a href="http://mabfan.com">Michael</a> and <a href="http://nomiburstein.com/">Nomi</a>, Jen and I got to see the PBS four-hour special on <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mormons/">the Mormons</a>. It was a fascinating documentary, but I found one omission curious: there was almost nothing about the church&#8217;s theology.</p>
	<p>Compared with most other sects that call themselves Christian, the Mormons have (at least) two striking differences in their conception of the divine. One is that they see God the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost as three separate individuals, rather than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity">three persons sharing a single divine essence</a>. Another is that the belief ח״ו that God was once a person and that a good Mormon may get his (or her?) own world to rule as a god in the afterlife: former <acronym title="Latter-Day Saints">LDS</acronym> president Lorenzo Snow summarized this principle by saying &#8220;As man is God once was, and as God is man may become&#8221;. (Cf. <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/132/20#20">D&#38;C 132:20</a>.) In other words, Mormons are polytheists.</p>
	<p>The documentary only refers to this belief elliptically and in passing, but I think it sheds an important light on the Mormon persecutions of the early nineteenth century (which precede Mormon polygamy by at least a decade). A number of other American Christian sects (e.g., the churches of Christ, the Disciples of Christ, and the Seventh-Day Adventists) were also inspired by the &#8220;Second Great Awakening&#8221; of 1800&ndash;1830, but they did not get such a violent reaction from the mainstream. Even the <a href="http://www.nyhistory.com/central/oneida.htm">Oneida Community</a>, whose doctrine of &#8220;complex marriage&#8221; made Mormon polygamy look downright prudish, did not face the same degree of persecution.</p>
	<p>I was reminded of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293088/">Devil&#8217;s Playground</a>, a documentary on the Amish that I saw a while back, because in that film, too, the doctrinal differences between the Amish and <em>other Christian sects</em> were glossed over. One of the Amish boys interviewed mentioned in passing that attending a Baptist church service was one of the &#8220;bad&#8221; things that Amish teenagers might indulge in during their <em>rumspringa</em>. One of the girls eventually decided not to join the Amish church and decided to go to college instead&#8212;to a sectarian Christian college. But these subjects&#8217; thoughts on the difference between the Amish faith and other forms of Christianity were not explored any further.</p>
	<p>Back when I was doing my bachelor&#8217;s thesis, one of my advisors&#8212;Lisa Rofel, an anthropology professor&#8212;warned me that I had to make sure to describe my subjects from &#8220;the native&#8217;s point of view&#8221;. In that respect, I fear that both of these documentaries fell a little short. To truly understand an exotic religious group (or interactions between several exotic religious groups), it helps to understand the aspects of their beliefs and practices that are most important <em>to them</em>, and not simply the ones that are most important to the stereotypical liberal documentary-watcher.</p>]]>

Two key points of their doctrine were that the only <em>real</em> Christians were the ones baptized into their network of churches, and that the quality of a Christian&#8217;s relationship with God is directly proportional to his or her success at making converts. Motivated by those beliefs, organized in an Amway-style pyramid system, and using some high-pressure sales tactics, the church racked up exponential growth for about ten years, until attrition caught up with them.</p>
	<p>One of the folks I interviewed for the series was a dean and a Christian pastor, who said that the BCC&#8217;s approach to making converts was all wrong. The early Christians, he said, attracted people by example. Flavius would see that Marcellus was good to his family, honest in business, etc., etc., and also hear that Marcellus worshipped some strange new god called &#8220;Jesus&#8221;; thus, Flavius became interested in Christianity. Imagine that&#8212;converting other people to your religion by <em>your own exemplary behavior</em>. What a tedious chore! You can&#8217;t just spend a few hours a week lecturing the heathen about how you are right and they are wrong, rattling off the talking points that you have carefully memorized in response to their well-meaning but ignorant questions. You have to <em>earn respect</em> from the people around you, and hope that respect for you as a person will lead to respect for your faith.</p>
	<p>But, friends and neighbors, I am here to testify that the dean&#8217;s strategy <em>actually works</em>. I am an Orthodox Jew today, in part, because of some of the Orthodox and frum-Conservative folks I met: people I liked, people I respected, people whom I identified with. And <em>none</em> of those folks were stumping for Chabad, Aish ha-Torah, or any other &#8220;bring non-Orthodox Jews to frumkeit&#8221; organization.</p>
	<p>By contrast, let me present <a href="http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070511/NEWS/705110337/1001/COMM01">a case study in how not to proselytize</a>:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>U.S. Navy veteran David Miller said that when he checked into the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Iowa City, he didn&#8217;t realize he would get a hard sell for Christian fundamentalism along with treatment for his kidney stones.</p><p>Miller, 46, an Orthodox Jew, said he was repeatedly proselytized by hospital chaplains and staff in attempts to convert him to Christianity during three hospitalizations over the past two years.</p><p>He said he went hungry each time because the hospital wouldn&#8217;t serve him kosher food, and the staff refused to contact his rabbi, who could have brought him something to eat.</p><p>...</p><p>Over the past two years, Miller said, he has been asked over and over by the Iowa City VA medical center&#8217;s staff within its offices, clinics and wards, &#8220;You mean you don&#8217;t believe that Jesus is the Messiah?&#8221; and &#8220;Is it just Orthodox Jews who deny Jesus?&#8221; He said one staffer told him, &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand; how can you not believe in Jesus; he&#8217;s the Messiah of the Jews, too, you know.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>If any of the Christians who made these comments think they were bringing Miller closer to their religion, they are deluding themselves. <em>At best</em>, they were annoying busybodies, like folks who lecture overweight strangers about what to eat. <em>At worst</em>, they were showing one another their loyalty to the &#8220;Christian&#8221; tribe by harrassing someone who was not a member. (And if Miller&#8217;s case ever turns into a lawsuit, we are sure to hear other members of this tribe wail and gnash their teeth about how they are being &#8220;persecuted&#8221;.)</p>
	<p>It is not my place, of course, to tell those Christians how to interpret the tenets of their own religion. I&#8217;d just like to encourage my fellow frummies to hold themselves to a higher standard. If it&#8217;s too much work to act in a way that conspicuously brings credit to your religion, at least try not to make it look <em>bad</em>, OK?</p>

<![CDATA[<p>My wife, who is frum and supports the State of Israel but is in no way a &#8220;religious Zionist&#8221;, gets her dander up every time she sees a bumper sticker saying &#8220;The Bible Says the Land of Israel Belongs to the Jews&#8221; and such-like.  So I had an idea the other day for a bumper sticker:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p style="text-align:center;">GOD GAVE THE LAND OF ISRAEL TO<br />
<em>(insert current occupants here)</em></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>From a Torah point of view, I think this statement is unassailable. As Yeshiahu Leibowitz ztz&#8221;l pointed out, just as God took the land from the Canaanites and gave it to us (cf. Rashi s.v. Genesis 1:1), He took it from us and gave it to the Assyrians, took it from the Assyrians and gave it to the Persians, etc., etc.</p>
	<p>But from a &#8220;not getting our tires slashed in the parking lot next to the kosher grocery store&#8221; point of view, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d want that sentiment on our car.</p>]]>

For example, you would lock the cell which stores the formula for the calculation, so that you can’t accidentally write over it.</p><p>Unfortunately, the software used here wasn’t the full-blown version of Excel or some functional equivalent, but something called PocketExcel. It doesn’t allow locked cells; someone tabbed into the wrong field and overwrote the calculated dose with the baby’s weight. Ouch!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, teacher/author/blogger Kathy Sierra announced that <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/03/as_i_type_this_.html">she had received death threats</a> as comments on some blogs run by other prominent figures in the tech-blogging community. (The blogs were soon shut down. The fellow who posted the comments that Kathy<sup><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn15124757554626f1990e420">1</a></sup> interpreted as death threats has <a href="http://misobserver.wordpress.com/2007/04/08/25/">denied any malicious intent</a>.) This led to an outpouring of sympathy from her readers, fellow-bloggers, and other people in the <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> field.</p>
	<p>One thing that surprised me about the response was the number of <em>other</em> women bloggers who said that they, too, had received death threats.  (See, for example, <a href="http://www.reclusiveleftist.com/?p=556">Reclusive Leftist</a>, <a href="http://www.minjungkim.com/2007/03/26/it%e2%80%99s-awful-yes/">Min Jung Kim</a>, and <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2007/03/26/safe_havens_for.html">apophenia</a>.)</p>
	<p>At any rate, most of the follow-up postings on IT blogs that I read shifted focus from the assault against Kathy to the general issue of &#8220;civility&#8221;, or the lack thereof, in blogs. Credible threats to commit murder and rape were subsumed in a more general category, one which included hyperbole, personal insults, and general bad language.</p>
	<p>Then Tim O&#8217;Reilly, Kathy&#8217;s friend and publisher, <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/04/draft_bloggers_1.html">drafted a Blogger&#8217;s Code of Conduct</a>, posting it just in time for the <em>New York Times</em> to write about it. In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/technology/09blog.html?ex=1177041600&#38;en=a7b24981660dbba0&#38;ei=5070">the <em>Times</em> article</a>, Tim gets first mentioned in the third paragraph; likewise for Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales. Kathy, &#8220;a high-tech book author from Boulder County, Colo., and a friend of Mr. O’Reilly&#8221;, makes her debut in the eleventh paragraph, as a member of &#8220;the insular community of dedicated technology bloggers<sup><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn295905704626f1990ebc9">2</a></sup>&#8221;.</p>
	<p>And since then, I&#8217;ve seen just scads and scads of commentary on Tim&#8217;s proposed code. Meanwhile, Kathy <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/04/my_favorite_gra.html">is no longer doing speaking engagements and is wondering what she can do to attract less negative attention</a>.</p>
	<p class="mtb">One of the less-obvious signs of social privilege is <em>the ability to set the agenda</em>. Even the bloggers who have fervently denounced the very concept of a Blogger&#8217;s Code of Conduct have, by posting their criticisms, <em>accepted the agenda that Tim set</em>.</p>
	<p>I don&#8217;t want to impugn Tim&#8217;s integrity and I don&#8217;t doubt his good intentions. But notice how this is no longer a discussion of online threats to murder, maim, or rape, which (as previously noted) seem to predominantly be issued by men against women. It&#8217;s a discussion of online incivility, <a href="http://blogging.wikia.com/wiki/BCC">defined to include a wide range of peccadilloes</a> that both men and women commit. It&#8217;s no longer a story about Kathy; it&#8217;s a story about Tim. Indeed, in <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/04/code_of_conduct.html">his most recent blog posting on the subject</a>, Tim remarked: &#8220;It concerns me that Kathy Sierra, whose bad experience triggered this discussion, thinks that a code of conduct such as I proposed would do no good.&#8221;</p>
	<p>The agenda has been reset. That&#8217;s <a href="http://catandgirl.com/view.php?loc=334">the patriarchy</a> in action.</p>
	<p class="mtb">Fortunately, <a href="http://www.crablaw.com/2007/04/take-back-blog-host-page.html">there are some people interested in re-resetting the agenda</a>. April 28 will be the day for a&#8230;</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><img src="http://www.crablaw.com/TakeBackTN.jpg" align="right" /> Take Back the Blog! Blogswarm in support of the rights of women to participate fully in all aspects of our society, including specifically online in the world of blogging but indeed everywhere and at all times, day and night, without fear of harassment, intimidation, sexual harassment, <a href="http://majikthise.typepad.com/majikthise_/2007/03/did_online_goss.html">online stalking and slander</a>, predation or violence of any sort.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Sounds good to me.</p>
	<p>Amid all the other commentary sparked by what happened to Kathy, I was pleased to discover <a href="http://siderea.livejournal.com/465523.html">siderea&#8217;s comparison of misogyny with Martians-are-out-to-get-me psychosis</a>, <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/03/misogyny_and_an.html">Seth Godin on misogynous bullying by a <em>New York Times</em> author</a>, <a href="http://liz-henry.blogspot.com/2007/03/patriarchy-exists-and-we-kicking-its.html">Liz Henry&#8217;s call to action</a>, and&#8230;hell, I can&#8217;t keep track of them all. So I&#8217;m glad there&#8217;s a chance for people to write more on this subject and a place where it can all be brought together.</p>
	<p class="fn" id="fn15124757554626f1990e420"><sup>1</sup> Are all bloggers, even those who have never met, on a first-name basis with one another?</p>
	<p class="fn" id="fn295905704626f1990ebc9"><sup>2</sup> Insular? What are we, Amish? When the <em>Times</em> manages to write about blogs without status anxiety dripping from the paper, the same issue will have a banner headline on page one saying &#8220;MESSIAH ANOINTED IN JERUSALEM&#8221;.</p>]]>

According to the <em>Jerusalem Post</em>, some rabbis are considering treating <em>marijuana</em> as <a href="http://www.aish.com/passlaw/passlawdefault/All_About_Kitniyot.asp">kitniyot</a>. Israel&#8217;s Green Leaf party, which ran on a pro-pot-legalization platform, is advising its frum members to put away their stashes for the holiday.</p>
	<p>Is there really a concern that people might mistake marijuana leaves (or even seeds) for chametz grains? Is it customary to grow or store marijuana in places where it might get mixed with chametz? And even if marijuana were classified as kitniyot&#8212;I thought the kitniyot ban applied to <em>eating</em>, but not to other forms of benefit. So <em>smoking</em> kitniyot should be OK, right? (At least, inasmuch as smoking <em>anything</em> is OK, what with the health risks and all. Not to mention that whole <em>dina d&#8217;malchutna dina</em> issue.)</p>
	<p>I hope that our rabbi will devote some time on Shabbat ha-Gadol to expound on these matters. I will donate some brownies for the kiddush.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>So you&#8217;re a probation officer, and you have to find a place for slome just-paroled sex offenders to live.  But there are laws about sex offenders living too close to schools, parks, day care centers, etc., and every residence you look at turns out to be in violations. No homeless shelter will take them, either.  So what do you do? If you&#8217;re in Miami, you direct the fellows to live in <a href="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2007-03-08/news/swept-under-the-bridge">a cardboard box under a bridge</a>.  Really.  Literally.</p>
	<p>Money quote #1:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>They live a block away from Kristi House, a treatment center for victims of child sexual assault. They&#8217;re also within 1000 feet of two day-care centers — a violation of state law — and less than 2500 feet from eight schools, a breach of county ordinance.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Whoops.</p>
	<p>Money quote #2:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Carrasquillo claims that Circuit Court Judge Cristina Pereyra-Shuminer, who didn&#8217;t return phone messages, knew he was being sent to the muddy location. &#8220;I told the judge to let me back into prison,&#8221; Carrasquillo says. &#8220;If I&#8217;d have known this was going to happen, I&#8217;d have finished my eight years there.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The obvious solution to this problem is to make rape of a minor and similarly scary crimes punishable by life in prison. Of course, if the prisons filled up with pedophiles, there wouldn&#8217;t be any room left for our captives from the War On [Some People Who Use Certain] Drugs&#8230;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
(I've got to blog about this before <a href="http://sethf.com/infothought/blog/">my distinguished homonym</a> does...)
</p><p>
The letters section of the latest <i>New Yorker</i> includes the following &#x201c;Editors&#x2019; Note&#x201d (the hyperlinks are my own):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The July 31, 2006, piece on Wikipedia, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060731fa_fact">“Know It All,” by Stacy Schiff</a>, contained an interview with a Wikipedia site administrator and contributor called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Essjay">Essjay</a>, whose responsibilities included handling disagreements about the accuracy of the site’s articles and taking action against users who violate site policy. He was described in the piece as “a tenured professor of religion at a private university” with “a Ph.D. in theology and a degree in canon law.”
</p><p>
Essjay was recommended to Ms. Schiff as a source by a member of Wikipedia’s management team because of his respected position within the Wikipedia community. He was willing to describe his work as a Wikipedia administrator but would not identify himself other than by confirming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Essjay/History1&oldid=37061026#Professional_Life">the biographical details that appeared on his user page</a>. At the time of publication, neither we nor Wikipedia knew Essjay’s real name. Essjay’s entire Wikipedia life was conducted with only a user name; anonymity is common for Wikipedia administrators and contributors, and he says that he feared personal retribution from those he had ruled against online. Essjay now says that his real name is Ryan Jordan, that he is twenty-four and holds no advanced degrees, and that he has never taught. He was recently hired by Wikia—a for-profit company affiliated with Wikipedia—as a “community manager”; he continues to hold his Wikipedia positions. He did not answer a message we sent to him; Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikia and of Wikipedia, said of Essjay’s invented persona, “I regard it as a pseudonym and I don’t really have a problem with it.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Updated to add:</b> Apparently, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales#The_New_Yorker_quotes_you">according to some Wikipedians</a>, it's OK to lie about your credentials on your user page because (a)&nbsp;it helps disguise your true identity from Bad People; (b)&nbsp;all Wikipedians are equal, regardless of how many formal degrees they have, so no harm is done by a Wikipedian who lies about how many formal degrees he has.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>There are many Deep and Meaningful and Significant things I would like to ramble about at great length, which of course is one reason why I haven&#8217;t posted anything here for six weeks.  So here&#8217;s a shallow and insignificant thought for the day.</p>
	<p>Our microwave oven has a <del>button</del> touch-sensitive blob labelled &#8220;ADD MINUTE&#8221;.  If you push it, it doesn&#8217;t actually add a minute to the cooking time; it adds thirty seconds.  But if the timer is already above a certain threshold, or maybe when you push the button enough times in rapid succession, each press <em>does</em> add one minute to the cooking time.</p>
	<p>But now I have a vision of the world&#8217;s most concise microwave-oven interface (imagine putting this on one of those itty bitty cubes): two <del>buttons</del> touch-sensitive blobs, “&#x2b;&#8221; and “✕&#8221;.  If you press “+&#8221; the time on the clock goes up by ten seconds, and if you press “✕&#8221; the time on the clock triples.  So thirty seconds is “+✕&#8221;.  One minute is “++✕&#8221;.  Five minutes would be “+✕✕+✕&#8221;. (From what I&#8217;ve read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_numeral_system">ternary arithmetic</a>, I suspect that making “✕&#8221; use any factor other than three would make the average button-pushing sequence longer, but I&#8217;m too lazy to work out a proof.)</p>
	<p>I release this innovative user interface into the public domain for the benefit of microwave-oven users everywhere. Please, don&#8217;t be too effusive in your thanks.</p>
	<p>P.S.: As long as I&#8217;m on the topic of weird number systems, I direct your attention to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio_base">golden-ratio base</a>, a system for representing numbers in base φ (or, if you&#8217;re a <em>Da Vinci Code</em> fan, base PHI).  Since φ+1 = φ<sup>2</sup>, any integer can be represented by a finite sequence of base-φ digits, <em>even though</em> φ is irrational. There must be some practical use for this, but I haven&#8217;t thought of one yet.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I was browsing through some data that my company had acquired from our good friends at the <a href="http://www.nga.mil/portal/site/nga01/">National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency</a>, and came across a reference to some place in Iraq called &#8220;Ḩayy Sab`at `Ashar (17) Tammūz&#8221;. <em>What&#8217;s that?</em> I wondered. <em>A name left over from the days when the Jewish people, exiled in Babylon, had fresh memories of the destruction of Jerusalem?</em></p>

<![CDATA[<p>Yesterday's <i>Globe</i> had <a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2006/11/18/love_it_or_leave_it?mode=PF">an article</a> (link will probably rot tomorrow) about how Allston, Massachusetts has been honored by inclusion in <i>The Absolutely Worst Places To Live In America</i>. The book&#x2014;whose author, a Boston College alumnus, can speak of Allston from personal experience&#x2014;refers to my neighboring neighborhood as &#x201c;a melting pot of upper-middle-class white kids eager to experience a brief taste of rebellious semiurban squalor&#x201d; full of &#x201c;faux Irish pubs, garbage, vomiting in the shrubbery, drunken brawling, late night/early morning car alarms&#x201d;.</p>
<p>This reminded me of the first two years of my marriage, when we lived in a basement apartment at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=168+Allston+St,+Allston,+MA&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=42.349347,-71.137977&spn=0.01367,0.043259&om=1&iwloc=addr">the corner of Allston and Kelton streets</a>. One morning we woke up to find a pool of vomit on the path leading to our door; judging from the residue along the outer wall and windowsills, it had come from someone living four stories up. Unfortunately, I was unable to rouse the perpetrator by pounding on his back door (at 10:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning), so I left a note of complaint with the landlord, complete with a diagram of the splatter marks. (To be fair, the landlord was letting us have the apartment at below market value, which, considering what market value was back then, was a sorely needed favor.)</p>
<p>I guess if you can make it there, you&#8217;ll make it anywhere.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Alan Dershowitz, in <em>The Best Defense:</em></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>During the late 1930s [my synagogue] decided to hire a professional rabbi to conduct services; one was brought over from Europe, but the congregants were not satisfied. After two weeks the newly hired rabbi was fired, given a small amount of severance pay, and sent on his way. A new rabbi was brought over from Europe, but he, too, was unceremoniously fired in a matter of weeks. This process continued until dozens of rabbis had passed through the &#8220;turnstile <em>shtible</em>&#8221; or the &#8220;Rabbi-of-the-Month Club,&#8221; as it began to be called. Everybody in the neighborhood understood this charade for what it was: a small-scale rescue operation designed to save European rabbis who were endangered by Nazism. For nearly a decade it succeeded in circumventing the restrictive immigration laws, by claiming a &#8220;need&#8221; for imported rabbis to lead the congregation.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><a href="http://slit.livejournal.com/326927.html">Civil disobedience in the age of globalization</a>:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>I woke up to the news that &#8220;our&#8221; imam was arrested last night by Homeland Security&#8230;for obtaining &#8220;religious worker&#8221; visas for Pakistanis, who then came here and worked as gas station attendants or in other secular jobs, in violation of the terms of their greencard. In other words this is a story about a bunch of immigrant Muslims who are guilty of being <em>not religious enough</em>... I&#8217;m guessing he did it, and if so I applaud him. He found a back door way to get young men out of an impoverished dictatorship where Islamist extremism is an ongoing issue and into the leafy suburbs of Massachusetts where they found full-time jobs and a supportive community. Too bad he got caught.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>P.S.: I find it interesting (but not terribly surprising) that <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/11/16/2_local_imams_arrested_in_alleged_visa_scheme?mode=PF">the <em>Globe</em> article covering the arrest</a> says virtually nothing about the folks who broke the law by <em>hiring</em> these guys in spite of their visa status. </p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>One reason I haven&#8217;t been doing much blogging recently is that I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time learning <a href="http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell">Haskell</a>, a computer language with a number of intriguing features.  Since I have previously remarked on <a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/yesh/article/why-java-is-the-wrong-language-for-enterprise-applications">weaknesses in Java&#8217;s type system</a>, I thought I would start by remarking on Haskell&#8217;s <em>type inference</em>. Unlike many of the language&#8217;s <em>other</em> intriguing features, this one is easy to demonstrate and its benefits are easy to explain.</p>
	<p>Consider this Haskell program:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>
main = do str &lt;- getLine
          let n = read str
          putStr "Twice that is "
          putStrLn (show (n * 2.0))
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote>
	<p>Like C, C++, and Java, Haskell is statically typed: every variable has a type that is known at compile time. <em>Un</em>like those other languages, though, you don&#8217;t have to explicitly declare the type of a variable when <em>the compiler can figure it out</em>. The compiler knows that <code>str</code> is a string, because that&#8217;s what the standard library function <code>getLine</code> returns<sup><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn6407022894557f564373ab">1</a></sup>.  The <code>read</code> function is polymorphic and can translate a string into any of a wide variety of Haskell types, but the compiler can still figure out the type of <code>n</code>, because it shows up later as an argument to <code>*</code>; since 2.0 is a floating-point number, then <code>n</code> must be one as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>
sethg@henbane:&#x7e;/Desktop/hs$ ./a.out
3.5
Twice that is 7.0
sethg@henbane:&#x7e;/Desktop/hs$ ./a.out
42
Twice that is 84.0
sethg@henbane:&#x7e;/Desktop/hs$ ./a.out
0x10
Twice that is 32.0
sethg@henbane:&#x7e;/Desktop/hs$ ./a.out
fred
Twice that is a.out: Prelude.read: no parse
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote>
	<p>I realize that programmers get into fervent religious wars over the question of static vs. dynamic typing, but I think I can avoid getting roasted by either side if I point out that <em>if</em> you have to use a statically typed language, it would be nice to use one with type inference. Why should we humans have to keep track of those tedious details if the computer can do it for us?</p>
	<p>PS: Notice how in the code, the <code>read</code> function appears <em>before</em> the call to print the phrase <code>Twice that is</code>, but in the output of the running program, the error message from <code>read</code> appears <em>after</em> that phrase. That&#8217;s <em>lazy evaluation</em>, another intriguing Haskell feature&#8230;.</p>
	<p class="fn" id="fn6407022894557f564373ab"><sup>1</sup> Actually, <code>getLine</code> is type <code>IO String</code>. Explaining how the output of this function gets bound to a variable of type <code>String</code> would require explaining Haskell&#8217;s monadic IO system, which I&#8217;m not ready to do just yet.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>(Let&#8217;s see if I&#8217;m sufficiently recovered from chagim-plus-new-baby to get back to blogging&#8230;)</p>
	<p>We&#8217;re trying to reintroduce the baby to bottle-feeding, and we were wondering if he&#8217;d be more likely to suck on a different kind of nipple.  So I did an amazon.com search for &#8220;nipple&#8221; and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nearly-Me-Gaff-17-400-Nude/dp/B0001ZO45Q/sr=8-2/qid=1163384314/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-0356342-6996827?ie=UTF8&#38;s=apparel">this</a> (warning: <acronym title="not very safe for work">NVSFW</acronym>) came up second in the results.</p>
	<p>I am amused by the contrast between the &#8220;Product Description&#8221; section and the &#8220;Customers who bought this item also bought&#8221; section.  Somebody should tell the vendor that there&#8217;s really no point to being coy about who their customers are.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Excerpt from <em>Tefillah Zakkah</em>:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Knowing as I do that hardly anyone is a righteous person who has not sinned against another one, either financially or physically, in word or in deed&#8212;this makes my heart tremble within me, because Yom Kippur does not atone for interpersonal sins until the offender appeases the victim. Regarding this, my heart is broken within me and my bones shake, because not even death atones. Therefore, I offer prayer before You that You pity me, and give me favor, kindness, and mercy in Your eyes, and in the eyes of all humanity. So I hereby completely forgive anyone who has sinned against me, either physically or financially, or one who gossipped about me, or even lied about me. So too, anyone who harmed me physically or financially. And for every sin that one person can commit against another, except for money that I could collect in a court of law, and except for someone who sins against me and says &#8220;I will hurt him and he will forgive me&#8221;&#8212;except for these, I completely forgive; and let no one be punished on my account. And just as I forgive everyone, so too may You put my favor before everyone else, so that they will completely forgive me.</p>

<![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1419607561?v=glance"><em>Murderer in the Mikdash</em></a> is much, much better-written than <em>Left Behind</em>. If you only buy one murder mystery set in the Jewish messianic era, you must buy this one.</p>
	<p>Umm.</p>
	<p>Let me try that again.</p>
	<p>If you want to write a novel that explores some society that your readers might not be familiar with, throw in a dead body. It&#8217;s a cheap trick, but it works: the reader&#8217;s primal motivation to see evil-doers brought to justice will keep them paying attention to the nuances of your world. Cases in point: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/CAVES-STEEL-ROBOTS-NO-1/dp/B000E8DQOU/sr=8-4/qid=1157335763/ref=pd_bbs_4/102-1143793-0668958?ie=UTF8&#38;s=books">The Caves of Steel</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alienist-Caleb-Carr/dp/0553572997/sr=8-1/qid=1157335841/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-1143793-0668958?ie=UTF8&#38;s=books">The Alienist</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Small-Town-Lawrence-Block/dp/0060011912/sr=8-2/qid=1157335872/ref=pd_bbs_2/102-1143793-0668958?ie=UTF8&#38;s=books">Small Town</a>.</p>
	<p>Gidon Rothstein uses <em>Murderer in the Mikdash</em> to explore what life will be like for Jews in Israel in the Messianic era. The book follows the opinion that this era will not be characterized by overt and spectacular miracles, but merely (ha!) an end to other nations dominating Israel. Rothstein&#8217;s kingdom has a king (who never appears onstage and is hardly ever mentioned), a &#8220;Democrats Anonymous&#8221; for people still getting used to the new order, a Temple where priests perform sacrifices, and cities where manslaughterers can take refuge from their victims&#8217; avengers. But it also has unhappy marriages, priests worried about the Temple&#8217;s financial solvency, corruption, racketeering, and, of course, murder. (Resurrection of the dead? Not yet, apparently.)</p>
	<p>The book&#8217;s main character is an investigative reporter and a non-observant Jew, which gives the author an excuse to describe certain mitzvot, such as the cities of refuge, in some detail. Rothstein shows admirable restraint by <em>only</em> spelling out details of post-messianic society that are relevant to his plot, although I wish he&#8217;d found excuses to explain more. (How, for example&#8212;this is one of my wife&#8217;s pet peeves&#8212;will <a href="http://www.thebricktestament.com/the_law/sexual_discharges/lv15_19b.html">transit authorities</a> change their ways to account for the laws of <em>niddah</em>?) By concentrating on the seamy side of post-messianic Israel, Rothstein prevents <em>Murderer in the Mikdash</em> from reading like a nineteenth-century utopian novel. The Israel he describes doesn&#8217;t look terribly attractive, <em>until</em> you compare it with the real Israel, the one with the Katyushas.</p>
	<p>While portraying the Jewish messianic age in fiction is a new idea (at least, new to me), the book draws heavily on stock thriller elements: the investigative reporter, the villain whose <strike>minyans</strike>minions are everywhere, the incriminating document that everyone is looking for, and so forth. If Rothstein had managed to breathe a little more originality into his characters&#8212;to bring Rachel Tucker up to the level of Elijah Baley&#8212;I would be recommending this book to everyone, even those with no interest in the religious angle. As it is, <em>I</em> enjoyed the book, and I think it might do well as a movie for Israeli TV, but&#8230;well, if you like this kind of thing, it&#8217;s the kind of thing that you will like.</p>]]>

	<blockquote>
		<p>There neither was nor is any need for busybody scientists to gin up a rigorous definition and then tell us Pluto doesn’t make the cut. It would be akin to gathering a giant conference to decide on a formal distinction between “bugs&#8221; and other small, gross animals. If we include worms do we need to include slugs? If we have slugs, then what about snails? And did you know that round worms (nematodes) are no more closely related to segmented worms (annelids) than they are to humans (chordates)? Well, I learned it about a year ago and suffice it say that I still use the word “worm&#8221; despite its lack of solid scientific backing. The world is getting on just fine.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Note that Yglesias is siding with fellow Harvard alumnus <a href="http://plutoisaplanet.org/officers.html">Michael A. Burstein</a>. A sign of how W.G.U. teaches its students to sympathize with the common folk? Or are members of one elite, Ivy League alumni, trying to expand their power at the expense of another, the International Astronomical Union?</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>A professional gambler is not allowed to be a witness before a Jewish religious court, because the Sages declared this practice to be a form of theft. The explanation that I&#8217;ve heard (I assume this is somewhere in the Talmud, but I don&#8217;t have time now to look for a citation) is that when you lay down money at a game of chance, you are not actually willing to lose it. Without that intention, the flow of money from the loser to the winner is morally tainted. The loser isn&#8217;t getting anything in exchange for the money that&#8217;s gone, and certainly didn&#8217;t intend it to be a gift.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Last week, DovBear <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2006/07/is-israels-counterattack-in-line-with.html">posted an essay by Michael Walzer</a> on how the principles of &#8220;just warfare&#8221; apply to Israel&#8217;s current war with Hezbollah. <a href="http://chardal.blogspot.com/">Chardal</a> objected to this whole line of argument, since it was not grounded in any Torah source. How can a frum Jew argue about &#8220;morality&#8221; based solely on principles expounded by non-Jewish jurists and philosophers? And if the Torah&#8217;s own principles on how Jews should fight wars conflicts with this &#8220;morality&#8221;, then why should we care about the latter?</p>

	<p>DovBear <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2006/07/can-idf-kill-civilians_31.html">followed up</a> with this argument: according to Maimonides, a Jewish king can fight an optional war for the sake of magnifying the country&#8217;s reputation. Obviously, in such a war, soldiers would be killed. Therefore, the modern State of Israel can regulate how it fights the current war for the sake of its reputation.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m not sure this line of argument works, since an optional war can only be fought with the permission of the Sanhedrin, which we don&#8217;t have. Let me suggest a couple of other reasons.</p><hr /><p>Following the international laws of war can be justified on purely amoral grounds. As <a href="http://www.blogmosis.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-view.cgi/24/entry/32500">Jonathan “Head Heeb” Edelstein argues</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>It is very rare for a military victory, no matter how decisive, to end the underlying conflict, and when the war is over, the issues will still have to be resolved and the conflicting parties rebuilt. Any measure that conserves human life and civilian infrastructure during the war will make those tasks that much easier, while scorched-earth warfare might win an immediate victory at the cost of making the underlying conflict more intractable. Israel, for instance, has won all its wars, some more decisively than others, but even its most spectacular military victories have failed to resolve the political conflicts that lie at their root. The ultimate solution has to be political, and in those cases where wars must be fought, it&#8217;s important to fight them in a way that doesn&#8217;t make reconstruction and mediation more difficult.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>From this point of view, the <span class="caps">IDF</span> has a good reason to protect Lebanese civilians <em>even if</em> the Torah has nothing to say on the matter. The question &#8220;how many soldiers&#8217; lives should we risk to avoid harming Lebanese civilians?&#8221; can be treated as a necessary strategic calculation, along the lines of &#8220;how many solders&#8217; lives should we risk to avoid compromising military intelligence?&#8221;</p><hr /><p>Furthermore, the Torah <em>does</em> have something to say on the matter, which dovetails nicely with Edelstein&#8217;s argument.</p>

	<p>Rabbi Yehuda Henkin, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9657108012/ref=sr_11_1/002-6386595-0760811?ie=UTF8"><em>Equality Lost</em></a>, has a chapter discussing a similar case: whether a terrorist who has been captured (and is therefore no longer a threat) may be summarily executed. According to the Geneva Conventions, even if such a person does not qualify as a prisoner of war, he is <em>hors de combat</em> and therefore may not be executed &#8220;without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples&#8221;. In the classical sources regarding Jewish warfare, there is no such protection (cf. Deuteronomy 20:12-13).</p>

	<p>However, Rabbi Henkin points out, the prohibition of <em>chillul haShem</em>, &#8220;desecration of God&#8217;s Name&#8221;, applies even when relating to non-Jews and even during wartime. Case in point: the Gibeonites (Joshua 9:3-27), who tricked the Jews into an oath of non-aggression.  <em>Even though</em> the Gibeonites were among the Canaanite nations whose extermination God had explicitly  ordered, and <em>even though</em> the oath that protected them was obtained through deceit, the Gemara concludes that because of <em>kedushat haShem</em>, Joshua was right to keep the oath; better to let the Gibeonites live than to have other nations say that Israel violates its oaths. Rabbi Henkin also cites the Jerusalem Talmud, Bava Kama 4:3, in which Rabban Gamliel taught Torah to officials of the Roman government. He followed a minority opinion that the Torah permits Jews to rob non-Jews, but once government officials learned of this law and said it was not &#8220;becoming and praiseworthy&#8221;, Rabban Gamliel outlawed this practice, because of <em>chillul haShem</em>.</p>

	<p>Rabbi Henkin concludes:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>When&#8230;an act is not widespread among the Gentiles, and their governments and scholars are unanimous in its condemnation, <em>chilul haShem</em> is certainly applicable, and such is the case regarding the killing of captured and bound terrorists.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The application to other &#8220;laws of civilized warfare&#8221; is straightforward. If Joshua and his princes were bound by an oath contracted under false pretenses, lest the neighboring countries somehow find out that it was broken, <em>how much more so</em> is the modern State of Israel, a country that has been formally at war since its inauguration, bound by the Geneva Conventions, when the slightest rumor of their violation is carried by <span class="caps">CNN</span> to the four corners of the world! Furthermore, even if Israel had not signed the Conventions, to the extent that those treaties codify practices that the rest of the world finds abhorrent, it would be <em>chillul haShem</em> to engage in those practices.</p><hr /><p>The only counterargument that I can think of is that Rabbi Henkin was describing a case where following the Geneva Conventions would not harm anyone, whereas taking too much effort to protect Lebanese civilians will lead to the deaths of many Israeli soldiers. I don&#8217;t know how the laws of <em>pikuach nefesh</em> apply to the strategic calculations of a Jewish state at war, but&#8230; </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Not every civilian death in wartime is a violation of the Conventions; soldiers are not required to kill enemy soldiers and only enemy soldiers with 100% accuracy. Surely there is a reasonable middle ground between the indiscriminate carpet-bombing that some hawks seem to long for, and rules of engagement that would make it practically impossible for Israel to win any battles.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>One could argue that <em>pikuach nefesh</em> requires Israel to abrogate the Conventions, but one could also argue that <em>pikuach nefesh</em> requires Israel to give up East Jerusalem to the Palestinians. Can one consistently argue for the first thesis and against the second?</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>How many Israeli soldiers&#8217; lives could <em>really, really</em> be saved if Lebanese civilian casualties were completely ignored? The French tried using terror to fight terror in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War_of_Independence">Algeria</a>, and look where it got them.</li>
	</ul>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve been participating in various Web-based forums for a while, you may have noticed the great variety of ways you can avoid polluting your fingers with HTML.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Some venerable bulletin-board systems use <a href="http://forums.ft.com/infopop/ubbcode.html">UBBCode™</a>. See, in HTML, if you want to make something <b>boldface</b>, you use &lt;b&gt;codes surrounded by angle brackets&lt;/b&gt;, but UBBCode™ uses [b]square brackets[/b], which are obviously superior.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Some blog software uses <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, where you can generate an ordered list by putting a digit in front of every list item and create a first-level header by starting a line with “#&#8221;. Others (including <a href="http://textpattern.com/">the software that runs this humble site</a>) use <a href="http://textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile</a>, where you use “#&#8221; to make an ordered list and &#8220;h1.&#8221; to make a header.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>In the Wiki world, you can usually make a link to another page simply by writing the page title in CamelCase. If you&#8217;re composing a page on a <a href="http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/">MoinMoin</a> wiki and you want to link to a page with normal capitalization, you put the page title in [square brackets].  But if you&#8217;re using <a href="http://twiki.org/">TWiki</a> or <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a>, you put it in &#x5b;&#x5b;<em>double</em> square brackets]]. And of course, if you want the text the user sees on the screen to be something other than the name of the page the link points to, TWiki and MediaWiki provide different ways to do that.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Of course, you can use HTML-style tags and escaping within most of these markup languages, but they all have their obscure rules lurking in the background regarding what they&#8217;ll accept. TWiki doesn&#8217;t allow newlines within an HTML tag (e.g., between an element name and its attributes). If you write an HTML tag in Textile with escaped angle brackets (like “&amp;lt;b&amp;gt&#8221;, Textile will happily translate those escaped characters back into angle brackets.  (Guess how I found that out.)</p>
	<p>Why this Babel of markup languages? I can imagine three justifications:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>HTML is hard.</li>
		<li>The alternative markup languages can be easily translated into valid (X)HTML on the server end, whereas if users are expected to type HTML into these little text boxes, then they&#8217;ll input &#8220;tag soup&#8221; that mucks everything up.</li>
		<li>Alternative markup languages allow you to add markup features that HTML doesn&#8217;t have<sup><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn116666907644cd657e11918">1</a></sup>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>To which I say</p>
	<ol>
		<li>And these other systems aren&#8217;t? Users who can&#8217;t stand typing in all these angle brackets are better off using <a href="http://kupu.oscom.org/">one of the new Javascript-based Web WYSIWYG editors</a>.</li>
		<li>That&#8217;s why we have tools like <a href="http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup/">TagSoup</a> and <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">HTML Tidy</a>.</li>
		<li>It would be better to add those features with language extensions that are consistent with HTML<sup><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn85432293844cd657e120e6">2</a></sup>, and then use XSL on the server side to rearrange things.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Some day, perhaps, in my Copious Free Time, I will write my own damn blog software that takes its XML straight. I&#8217;m sure there are three or four other geeks in the world who would appreciate such a thing. In the meantime, if you want to write a comment on this fine blog for posterity<sup><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn210483569244cd657e128b5">3</a></sup>, you have to use Textile markup. It&#8217;s really quite easy once you get the hang of it.</p>
	<p class="fn" id="fn116666907644cd657e11918"><sup>1</sup> Footnotes, for instance.</p>
	<p class="fn" id="fn85432293844cd657e120e6"><sup>2</sup> The user could, for example, put &lt;span class=&#8221;footnote&#8221;&gt;(body of footnote)&lt;/span&gt; wherever he or she wanted a footnote marker, and the server could move that text to the end of a document and put the appropriate footnote mark in its place.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>OK, I&#8217;ve been defending Israel&#8217;s actions in Lebanon because, in the absence of other information, I want to give them the benefit of the doubt that they are trying in good faith to fight a clean war, to the extent that such a thing is possible.</p>
	<p>That&#8217;s a little harder to do when seeing news like <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1153291987290&#38;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">this</a></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>A high-ranking [Israel Air Force] officer caused a storm on Monday in an off-record briefing during which he told reporters that IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Dan Halutz had ordered the military to destroy 10 buildings in Beirut in retaliation to every Katyusha rocket strike on Haifa.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>At least the IDF had the decency to be embarrassed by a threat to violate article 33 of the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/92.htm">Fourth Geneva Convention</a>:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>The IDF Spokesperson&#8217;s Office later retracted its accusation that reporters had misquoted the officer and issued a second statement claiming that the high-ranking officer had made a mistake and was wrong in claiming that Halutz had issued such a directive.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>One of the main critiques (from the left) of Israel&#8217;s behavior in Lebanon goes roughly like this: hundreds of Lebanese civilians are dying under Israeli bombs, and hundreds of thousands have been made refugees; therefore, Israel is doing something wrong. Nobody denies that Hezbollah stations itself <em>among</em> civilians, but a lot of folks seem to believe that Israel is capable of targeting its weapons with more precision, and their failure to do so proves that they are not taking due care to prevent civilian casualties.</p>
	<p>But none of the people who made this critique have given me a persuasive answer to a simple question: &#8220;if <em>you</em> were the Israeli Minister of Defense, what course would <em>you</em> have taken that would have been appropriately proportional and taken appropriate care to protect Lebanese civilians?&#8221;</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In 2004, Israel exchanged 430 live Arab prisoners for the corpses of three Israeli soldiers and one Israeli businessman who had been captured in 2000. That swap did not, it seems, do much to improve good relations with Hezbollah. I see no reason why Israel should reward Hezbollah by setting loose a few hundred more of its prisoners.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Back in the opening days of the second intifada, Israel responded to suicide bombers in a measured tit-for-tat fashion. A suicide bomber would kill a few dozen Israelis, and Israel, holding the Palestinian Authority responsible for not reining in Palestinian terrorists, would bomb a PA police station. Another suicide bomber would go off, and another police station would get bomb. Eventually, the PA police officers realized that whenever they heard news of a suicide bombing, it would be a good day to work from home. The suicide bombings continued even after the PA ran out of police stations.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002366.html">Max Sawicky remarked</a> that &#8220;Like Bush after 9-11, Israel squandered its moral authority in about 48 hours.&#8221; But what could Israel have done in two or three days that would have any significant effect on Hezbollah? (I agree that there&#8217;s no way Israel can eliminate Hezbollah entirely through military action, but there&#8217;s a long distance between &#8220;eliminate entirely&#8221; and &#8220;speak sternly to&#8221;.) After two or three days <em>without</em> bombs flying over their heads, the many surviving Hezbollah guerrillas would have dug in to new positions, the bomb craters in the roads would have been paved over, and new truck-mounted missiles would have been on their way from Syria.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Well, Israel could have responded to the kidnapping of its soldiers by withdrawing to the 1967 borders, releasing all of its prisoners of war, and granting the right of return to all descendants of the Palestinians who fled or were driven out of the country in 1948. Do I even need to explain why that&#8217;s not a serious answer?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Also, just for a point of comparison, <a href="http://www.michaeltotten.com/archives/001189.html">here</a> is how the US Army in WW2 showed due care for the lives of German civilians. No, I&#8217;m not talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden_bombing">Dresden</a>, which was arguably an anomaly.  This was standard operating procedure:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Americans, in avoiding the heavy concentration of anti-aircraft fire around military targets, dropped from high altitudes and often with little ability to really aim for what they were after. The fact that such military targets as rail junctions and large-scale processing and manufacturing industries tend naturally to be surrounded by dense blocks of homes meant this tactic could be, and often was, as lethal as deliberate city-bombing.</p><p>And how do the ethics of air power apply to a ground war? The U.S. Army pushed through central Germany in the spring of 1945, with the German military before it mostly reduced to small ill-trained units, but when the Americans met any sustained resistance they pulled back, called in artillery, and blasted whatever was in front of them, whether it was a wooded ridge or a farming village.</p><p>The experience of Neuhof in the Frankenhöhe was typical of hundreds of other small German towns. The 92nd Cav. Recon Squadron reached it toward evening on April 15 and ran into a battle group of young SS soldiers north of the town. The Americans held off and pounded the town with artillery all night. In the morning, they waited for the fog to lift, then blasted Neuhof with phosphorous shells, setting everything ablaze. They attacked again at noon with infantry and tanks, but they still met resistance, so they poured more artillery and tank fire into the town. They finally took it at 5 p.m. that evening.</p></blockquote>
	<p>I don&#8217;t blame Lebanese civilians for having the misfortune of living next to extremely well-armed thugs<sup><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn198218584644c4b6c0e822b">1</a></sup>. And if IDF officers <em>aren&#8217;t</em> making a good faith effort to aim at legitimate targets<sup><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn22349455744c4b6c0e89f9">2</a></sup>, but deliberately trying to turn the country into a wasteland, well, let my words be null and void and let the responsible parties on both sides go to hell (or the <acronym title="International Criminal Court">ICC</acronym>). But if Israel is persuaded to call off attacks on Hezbollah positions <em>simply because</em> there are lots of civilians nearby, then that will only encourage other armies devoted to Israel&#8217;s destruction to put their own civilian neighbors in the same jeopardy.</p>
	<p class="fn" id="fn198218584644c4b6c0e822b"><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-dershowitz22jul22,0,7685210.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail">Alan Dershowitz argues</a> that any civilians who choose to hang around southern Lebanon after Israel dropped leaflets telling them to evacuate are &#8220;complicit&#8221;. <a href="http://www.michaeltotten.com/cgi-bin/mt/sayitsayitsayit.cgi?entry_id=1183">Others</a> go so far as to say that Lebanese civilians don&#8217;t deserve our sympathy because, well, they could have evicted Hezbollah themselves, but they didn&#8217;t.  (They could have? How? Voodoo?) Of course, if you swallow this line, you have no grounds to complain when Hezbollah and Hamas bomb Israeli civilians who voted the current government into power.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>While reading <a href="http://isbn.nu/0670034665"><em>Self-Made Man</em></a>, Norah Vincent&#8217;s story of spending a year and a half passing for male, I came across an analysis of how men in a bowling league she joined would try to help her with her game. She recounted how, as a female athlete, she got back-stabbing and catty remarks from other women; by contrast, the men in &#8220;Ned&#8221;&#8217;s league, even the men from opposing teams, kept trying to give &#8220;him&#8221; practical advice.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>...[T]hey seemed to have a competitive stake in my doing well and helping me to do well, as if beating a man who wasn&#8217;t at his best wasn&#8217;t satisfying. They wanted you to be good <em>and then</em> they wanted to beat you on their own merits.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>When I first read that, I thought, <em>Oh, that&#8217;s an interesting insight into the difference between men and women.</em> But the next day, mulling over what I had read, I realized that it had no connection to <em>my own</em> experience as a man dealing with other men. OK, I&#8217;ve never belonged to an athletic league, but I&#8217;ve been a member of a writers&#8217; workshop; I&#8217;ve volunteered for various political organizations; I was a gabbai and board member at a synagogue. When it comes to helping me be a more competent member of these organizations (or not), I don&#8217;t notice a difference between how my male and female co-volunteers have treated me. Certainly I don&#8217;t see the drastic contrast that Vincent saw between one group of working-class middle-aged men at a bowling alley and another group of upper-class teenage girls at a tennis camp. Maybe this attitude is confined to all-male sports teams&#8212;but I know I&#8217;m not the only guy who avoids team sports.</p>
	<p>And that, in a nutshell, is my reaction to <em>Self-Made Man</em>. Based on her experience among men in some of the most stereotypically male environments (e.g., a bowling league, a Catholic monastery, and a <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em>&#8212;style sales job), she has drawn sweeping conclusions about The Inner Lives of Men, many of whom <em>don&#8217;t want</em> to be in such environments. (League bowling is so unpopular these days that <a href="http://www.bowlingalone.com/">a book on the decline of American communities</a> uses it as a case in point. The Catholic Church in America is having trouble finding young men willing to become parish priests, let alone monks. The sales job that Vincent took had such a high turnover that managers were constantly interviewing new candidates.)</p>
	<p>One notable weakness of Vincent&#8217;s research is her lack of investigation into how men behave and feel <em>as husbands</em>. She observes them in all-male environments where they are taking a recess from their marriages, so to speak (such as the bowling league), or not married at all (such as the monastery). The closest she comes to a mixed environment is when she investigates the heterosexual dating scene. When she remarks on how reluctant men are to share their emotions, and speculates on how this may be wounding them psychologically, I want to shout at her through the page: &#8220;Well, duh!  Men are reluctant to share their emotions <em>with other men</em>.  They depend <em>on the women they&#8217;re intimate with</em> for emotional support. That&#8217;s why, for example, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&#38;db=PubMed&#38;list_uids=1609871&#38;dopt=Abstract">men are more likely than women to get depressed following a divorce</a>!&#8221;</p>
	<p>Given how often men and women see one another as <a href="http://www.marsvenus.com/">members of an alien species</a>, it&#8217;s nice to have books that help people of one gender understand the feelings of the other. But the information conveyed by this book only describes a part of the male population&#8212;how large a part, I don&#8217;t know&#8212;and I worry about female readers who apply it to the rest of the gender.</p>
	<p>There.  Now I&#8217;ve shared my feelings.</p>]]>

	<p><a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/coffeehouse/2006/jul/18/10_comments_on_the_current_crisis_in_the_middle_east">Daniel Levy</a>, as well, doesn&#8217;t think much of that whole &#8220;unilateral withdrawal&#8221; business:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Israel withdrew from the Sinai in the context of a negotiated peace agreement with Egypt and from parts of the Arava in a  negotiated peace treaty with Jordan, results: quiet borders, no military exchanges since, solid if cool peace. Israel withdrew from South Lebanon and Gaza unilaterally without agreements … enough said.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Now, I can understand why a Bibi Netanyahu fan would say &#8220;See, I told you that unilateral withdrawal was a bad idea.&#8221; But these guys are <em>leftists</em>.  WTF?  Instead of pulling Israeli troops out of a morale-sapping occupation of southern Lebanon, PM Ehud Barak should have kept them there until&#8230;what? Instead of moving Jewish civilians out of settlements where they were surrounded on all sides by hostile Arabs and therefore required a disproportionate share of military resources to defend, PM Ariel Sharon should have let them stay there until&#8230;what?</p>
	<p>As early as 1968, Yeshayahu Leibowitz זצ״ל argued that Israel should unilaterally withdraw from the Arab-majority land that it conquered during the Six-Day War. After predicting (correctly) the corruption the state would suffer if it had to maintain an occupation of hostile foreigners, Leibowitz said:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Out of concern for the Jewish people and its state we have no choice but to withdraw from the territories and their population of one and a half million Arabs; this action to be done without any connection with the problem of peace. I speak of <em>withdrawal</em> from the territories and not of &#8220;returning them,&#8221; because we have no right to decide to whom to return them: to Jordan&#8217;s King Hussein? to the PLO? to the Egyptians? to the local inhabitants? It is neither our concern nor our obligation nor our right to decide what the Arabs will do with the territories after we withdraw from them. (&#8220;The Territories&#8221;, reprinted in <em>Judaism, Human Values, and the Jewish State</em>, p.&nbsp;226)</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Twenty years later, Leibowitz argued:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Some people oppose the withdrawal from the occupied territories on the grounds of security. Arab tanks will be stationed twenty-five kilometers from Tel-Aviv and fifteen kilometers from Natanyah. They ignore the fact that Israeli tanks would be stationed twenty-five kilometers from Shechem and two kilometers from Gaza&#8230; (&#8220;Forty Years After&#8221;, <em>ibid.</em>, p.&nbsp;246)</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The current war with Lebanon is a test of Leibowitz&#8217;s thesis: can Israel effectively defend its border without maintaining a perpetual buffer zone of occupied territory? If Israel passes the test, withdrawal from the West Bank will be more politically feasible as well.</p>
	<p>P.S.: An effective defense does not merely repulse the enemy military forces but protects, as much as feasible, innocent civilians on both sides. I can&#8217;t blame people for being skeptical of how well Israel is protecting Lebanese civilians, but I don&#8217;t yet see how the IDF can do a better job at this task without getting back into the occupation business&#8212;and such an occupation won&#8217;t be good for civilians, either. Remember the Sabra and Shatila massacres?</p>
	<p>P.P.S.: All the right-wingers who are encouraging Israel to not only turn Lebanon into glass but go after Syria and Iran&#8212;and encouraging the US government to do the same&#8212;please put down your World War II histories and read Josephus. Being the most zealous nationalist army in your neighborhood is not always a ticket to glorious victory. Sometimes it&#8217;s a ticket to national destruction.</p>
	<p>P.P.P.S.: I suppose, as an American, I should say something about what the US should do to bring peace to the region. OK, here&#8217;s what we should do: get ourselves a competent President. </p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Every once in a while, a writer from outside the SF community gets touched by our peculiar muse, and produces an excellent work that is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/038549081X/sr=8-1/qid=1152580899/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-4271709-1492830?ie=UTF8">recognizably SF</a>, or at least <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/015602943X/sr=8-2/qid=1152581089/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-4271709-1492830?ie=UTF8">something damn close to it</a>. Books like this make the true believers grind their teeth and mutter &#8220;if only SF wasn&#8217;t considered a subliterary genre, then books like this would be published as SF, and people who liked them would actually deign to consider reading other SF books.&#8221;</p>
	<p>Then, every once in a while, we encounter books like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312340966/qid=1152581244/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-4271709-1492830?s=books&#38;v=glance&#38;n=283155"><em>Prodigy</em></a>, which do not bear the imprint of any SF publishing house, and thank God and Campbell for that.  This tale, by a man who was &#8220;kicked out of several prep schools&#8221;, is about the prep school of the future: Stansbury, which charges $500K tuition (in 2036 dollars) to cultivate young minds using nonunion labor, cutting-edge drugs, and a rigorous educational program, thus turning out hordes of young men and women ready to <del>fight aliens</del> become leaders of science, industry, and athletics. The murder-mystery-cum-thriller plot is nothing special; this book is distinguished by such thrilling flights of speculation as:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>The rubber-Teflon blend in the soles of Smith&#8217;s work boots&#8230;gripped the slick pavement as he pivoted into an alley off 3rd Street on Avenue R.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Wow, it&#8217;s a good thing the sneaker companies of the future thought to mix rubber with the Teflon in their soles, so that the shoes could grip the pavement better.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>The dopazone molecules transferred digitally from the site&#8217;s mainframe server to Cooley&#8217;s terminal by bouncing in between thirty-eight separate destinations, all of which were decoys designed to throw off Stansbury&#8217;s built-in security system&#8230;. The dopazone molecules rode the electric currents and shot through the wrist cuff, transferring past the skin and into his bloodstream.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>I&#8217;ve heard of Internet addiction, but <em>really</em>...!</p>
	<p>Nothing to see here for anyone with a passing knowledge of science fiction, except perhaps as an object lesson in How Not To. If you run into any <em>non</em>-fen who have read this book and actually liked it, please beg them to pick up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553380958/sr=8-1/qid=1152583167/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-4271709-1492830?ie=UTF8">some SF thriller by a writer who&#8217;s actually competent</a>.</p>]]>

<p>The complaint relates that local pastor, Jerry Fike, in his invocation, followed requests for “our heavenly Father’s” guidance for the graduates with: “I also pray for one specific student, that You be with her and guide her in the path that You have for her. And we ask all these things in Jesus’ name.”...</p>
<p>District teachers and staff led Bible clubs at several schools. Club members got to go to the head of the lunch line... A middle school teacher told students there was only “one true religion” and gave them pamphlets for his surfing ministry....</p>
<p>Classmates accused [sixth-grader] Alex Dobrich of “killing Christ” and he became fearful about wearing his yarmulke, the complaint recounts. He took it off whenever he saw a police officer, fearing that the officer might see it and pull over his mother’s car.

<![CDATA[<p>I have decided to stop caring about the flag-burning amendment. Carving out this one little exception to American free-speech jurisprudence would be a <em>stupid</em> thing to do, but its practical effect on our ability to express ourselves would be infinitesimal. If the amendment is ever ratified and I&#8217;m sufficiently pissed off at the government, I can always burn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States">the Great Seal of the United States</a> or some such.  And if some Democratic members of Congress need to curry favor with swing voters, I&#8217;d much rather see them do it by voting to restrict flag-burning rights than by voting to restrict abortion rights.</p>
	<p>However, the next time this issue comes round on the guitar, I would encourage every non-Southern Democrat to propose a different form of the amendment: <a href="http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/flag.htm">Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States, and the flying of the Confederate flag.</a> You want a wedge issue, Mr. Rove?

<![CDATA[<p>When the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld,</em> it held that <em>even if</em> the Guant&aacute;namo detainee&#8217;s rights under the Geneva Conventions were being violated, an American court had no jurisdiction to intervene; violations of the Geneva Conventions were supposed to be handled through political and diplomatic channels, not through the courts. In response, today&#8217;s Supreme Court decision said:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>We may assume&#8230;even that [the Geneva Conventions of 1949] would, absent some other provision of law, preclude Hamdan&#8217;s invocation of the Convention&#8217;s provisions as an independent source of law binding the Government&#8217;s actions and furnishing petitioner with any enforceable right. For, regardless of the nature of the rights conferred on Hamdan, they are, as the Government does not dispute, part of the law of war. And compliance with the law of war is the condition upon which the authority set forth in [Uniform Code of Military Justice] Article 21 is granted. (<a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-184.pdf" title="2006">Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. ___</a>, at 64-65 [footnotes and internal citations omitted])</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Observe how, one one level, Justice Stevens is <em>agreeing</em> with the appeals court. The courts&#8217; authority to enforce the Geneva Conventions, he says, stems from <em>the act of Congress</em> incorporating the laws of war into the <acronym title="Uniform Code of Military Justice">UCMJ</acronym>, so he can skip over any question of whether the Conventions&#8217; status <em>as treaties</em> gives the court any power.  In other words, if Congress had passed a law that explicitly denied the protection of the Geneva Conventions to prisoners at Guant&aacute;namo, the Supreme Court would have probably found it constitutional.</p>
	<p>We should be thankful that the Bush Administration <em>didn&#8217;t</em> try to push such a law through Congress; back when his approval ratings were above 80 percent, the President could have proposed a law requiring summary execution for all terrorists, and at least half the Democrats in Congress would have voted for it. But think of it from the point of view of Cheney and the other Nixon alumni. Why ask the legislature for permission to do something that, as far as you&#8217;re concerned, is part of the &#8220;inherent authority&#8221; of the executive? No sense in letting the war against al-Qaeda interfere with your plans to seize power from al-Congress&#8230;</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>When Kibbutz Degania, the first socialist kibbutz in Israel, announced that it was going to build a synagogue on site, Rabbi Dr. Dalia Sara Marx, a teacher at Hebrew Union College, <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3262559,00.html">responded with bewildered disappointment, if not outrage</a>. How, she asked, could a community that carried the flame of progressive Judaism invite&#8212;shudder&#8212;<em>Orthodox</em> rabbis to oversee their spiritual life<sup><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn160123320244ad12dc3be50">1</a></sup>?</p>
	<p>Rabbi Yaakov Menken cited this essay and <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2006/06/18/tolerance-only-goes-so-far/">remarked</a>: &#8220;Simply amazing. She’s all for pluralism and tolerance, as long as people don’t choose Orthodoxy.&#8221; In <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2006/06/22/the-meaning-of-pluralism/">a follow-up posting</a>,  he expanded on his point: there are many instances in which the Reform movement refers to &#8220;pluralism&#8221; including both Reform and Orthodox Judaism as a good. But Rabbi Marx, in her op-ed, was not in such an inclusive mood.</p>
	<p>I think we can save Rabbi Marx from the charge of hypocrisy if we distinguish <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/notes/berlin.html">value pluralism</a>, the belief that there are multiple (but not infinite) legitimate human values worth pursuing, from <em>political</em> pluralism. If you skim the results of Rabbi Menken&#8217;s <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=reform+pluralistic+judaism">Google search</a> for &#8220;reform pluralistic judaism&#8221;, most of them refer to pluralism <em>within the Israeli political system</em>&#8212;that is, the Reform movement wants to grant them the same legal powers as the Orthodox rabbinate there currently enjoys. Reform rabbis can want this status without admitting any glimmer of suspicion that the Orthodox way of doing things is <em>right</em>.  (If they did, then one could use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager">Pascal&#8217;s wager</a> to convince them to become Orthodox.)</p>
	<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; you may object, &#8220;Rabbi Marx is still being hypocritical, because while she wants to <em>in</em>clude Reform in a pluralistic Judaism on the national level, she wants to <em>ex</em>clude Orthodoxy on the kibbutz level.&#8221; In order to answer this objection, we must address the question: why is political pluralism a good thing? Why<sup><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn127996705344ad12dc3c68c">2</a></sup> shouldn&#8217;t a Reform Jew aspire to replace the Orthodox monopoly on Jewish state religion with a Reform monopoly?</p>
	<p>The answer, I think, has to do with our dual nature as social and rational beings. On the one hand, we need to belong to groups in order to accomplish most of the things we want to do in society. On the other hand, once we <em>do</em> belong to a group, the goal of <em>perpetuating and protecting the group,</em> or submitting to high-status members of the group, can easily take priority over whatever goals the group was originally established to advance.  (The various Catholic Church sexual-abuse scandals are cases in point.)</p>
	<p>One excellent way to prevent this from happening is to set up a society where <em>multiple groups pursue overlapping goals and keep one another in check</em>. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the US government have the overlapping goal of protecting the Constitution. Verizon and Cingular have the overlapping goal of providing cellular phone service. <a href="http://dailykos.com/">Daily Kos</a> and <a href="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/">TAPPED</a> have the overlapping goal of getting Republicans out of power. Etc., etc., etc.</p>
	<p>Thus, one could argue that the State of Israel would be better off if it had multiple Jewish state-religious hierarchies<sup><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn198057512444ad12dc3cdef">3</a></sup>, with the overlapping goal of managing the religious lives of Israeli Jews. At the same time, one could argue, without hypocrisy, that each Jewish community <em>within Israel</em> would be better off inviting the single variant of Judaism that best fit its values. (It&#8217;s not like Rabbi Marx was lobbying for a Reform synagogue to be built in Mea Shearim.)</p>
	<p>P.S.: While the word &#8220;pluralism&#8221; frequently carries connotations of warm and fuzzy liberalism, my arguments above for political pluralism, based on a recognition of human frailty, are firmly within the conservative tradition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burke">Edmund Burke</a>.</p>
	<p>P.P.S.: There is no single rabbinic or lay organization that speaks for &#8220;Orthodox Judaism&#8221; as a whole (in the way that, for example, the <a href="http://www.ccarnet.org/">Central Conference of American Rabbis</a> represents the Reform movement). If you want to know whether a certain borderline practice (e.g., giving aliyot to women or believing that the late Lubavitcher Rebbe is the Messiah) is &#8220;really Orthodox&#8221; or not, there are a number of well-respected rabbis, some with formal positions of leadership, that will give their opinions, but there is no one institution that is entitled to have the last word.  Thus, in the political sense, the Orthodox movement is <em>more pluralist than the Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist movements</em>&#8212;perhaps even more pluralist than all of them put together.  Neener, neener, neener. </p>
	<p class="fn" id="fn160123320244ad12dc3be50"><sup>1</sup> One could just as easily ask: why, despite the general Israeli public&#8217;s low opinion of the rabbinic establishment, has the Reform movement had so little traction among native-born Israelis? </p>
	<p class="fn" id="fn127996705344ad12dc3c68c"><sup>2</sup> Aside from political expediency, which of course is never a factor in Israeli politics. (No, never! What, never? Well&#8230;<em>hardly</em> ever.)</p>
	<p class="fn" id="fn198057512444ad12dc3cdef"><sup>3</sup> Alternatively, Yeshiahu Leibowitz argued that the State of Israel would be better off without any state religion at all, and the Orthodox rabbinate would be better off without depending on government subsidy. I am more inclined to this point of view.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p><a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/yesh/article/greetings-from-virginia">As previously noted</a>, I am transferring my DSL service from Speakeasy ($70/month) to Verizon ($15/month). What I didn&#8217;t expect, when I made that fateful call to cancel my Speakeasy service, is there are a few (three? five? O Lord, when will it end?) days of lag between Speakeasy cutting me off and Verizon even <em>starting</em> to hook me up to its own systems.</p>
	<p>After about two hours on the phone with Verizon&#8217;s tech-support department, its provisioning department, its sales department, and its those-&shy;that-&shy;tremble-&shy;as-&shy;if-&shy;they-&shy;were-&shy;mad department, we have finally heard from someone who sounds technically clueful, and she has convinced us that &#8220;it takes three to five days&#8221; is <em>not</em> phone-company shorthand for &#8220;three to five days after the order shows up in our in-box, some technician finds the time to come down to the central office and disconnect two cables&#8221;. So I can&#8217;t get <em>too</em> mad at Verizon for the delay.</p>
	<p>But in the meantime, our house is off the Net. My wife and I can&#8217;t surf the Web from home; we can&#8217;t email from home. More importantly, we can&#8217;t manage our online bill payment from home, we can&#8217;t work on selling our car through Craigslist from home, and I can&#8217;t log in to work from home. How did people ever <em>live</em> this way?</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>If you can see this (and the domain name in your browser doesn&#8217;t begin with &#8220;groundcherry&#8221;), then your DNS client can see ropine.com at its new IP address, which points to a virtual server run by the nice folks at <a href="http://openhosting.com/home">OpenHosting</a>.</p>
	<p>There is a certain cachet to being able to tell people &#8220;go to this URL and you will see a Web page served from a computer that is <em>in my basement</em>&#8221;, but it&#8217;s not worth the tzuris of losing a long weekend&#8217;s worth of hits, or more, when the server flakes out and I can&#8217;t go down to that basement and fix it right away.</p>
	<p>Also, it turns out that it will cost <em>less</em> for me to get a virtual server at OpenHosting (where I am still root within my sandbox) plus a standard DSL service for home (the kind that doesn&#8217;t let me run a server), than it&#8217;s costing me now to have a static IP address (the kind that <em>does</em> let me run a server in my basement) through <a href="http://speakeasy.net">Speakeasy</a>.</p>
	<p>(If you <em>do</em> want to host a Web server in your basement, or have some other reason to want a geek-friendly ISP, we heartily recommend Speakeasy. We have no complaints about the service they&#8217;ve given us; it&#8217;s just that we&#8217;re moving on to a different kind of service.)</p>

	<p>Once upon a time, an alumnus of a world-famous yeshiva was convicted of embezzlement. A reporter asked the rosh yeshiva, &#8220;How do you feel about this failure of your educational system?&#8221;  The rosh yeshiva replied, &#8220;On the contrary, I consider him one of our system&#8217;s greatest successes. Sure, he ended up an embezzler, but if he <em>hadn&#8217;t</em> gone to our school, he would have become, God forbid, a murderer!&#8221;</p>
	<p>In that vein, I suppose it&#8217;s a good thing that the lads in Borough Park, unlike us poor benighted Modern Orthodox folks, have community leaders who are &#8220;<a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2006/04/05/the-cardinals-chovevei-torah-and-crossing-lines/#more-715">so suffused with Torah excellence that [their] world view is a refraction of Torah itself</a>&#8221;.

<![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON, April 1 (<abbr title="April Fool's Press">AFP</abbr>)&#8212;After years of tussling with Congress over establishing an <code>.xxx</code> top-level domain for pornography, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/">International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</a> (ICANN) has unveiled a compromise: a new top-level domain encompassing not only pornography, but any Internet content deemed &#8220;not safe for work&#8221;.</p>
	<p>While everyone has their own opinion about how to define pornography, the new <code>.nsfw</code> domain will be governed by simple and objective standards. Any employer who believes that the content available on a Web site is not safe for work may file a complaint with a special ICANN committee, whose members are nominated by the <a href="http://www.uschamber.com/">United States Chamber of Commerce</a>. The committee has the authority to reassign any IP address to a new domain in the <code>.nsfw</code> hierarchy. Employers can filter access to all these domains, and be assured that their workers are not endangering themselves on the Internet. Consumers will be allowed to access <code>.nsfw</code> domains from home, of course, but if they have trouble reaching them, they will not be able to get help from their Internet service providers, since the ISP&#8217;s technical-support workers will have their access filtered.</p>
	<p>If the owner of a site believes that he or she was put in the <code>.nsfw</code> domain by mistake, he or she can petition the NSFW Board of Appeal, which meets to hear such disputes in the bar of the Raffles Hotel, in Singapore, from 10:00&nbsp;a.m. to noon every February 29.</p>
	<p>A spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.eff.nsfw">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> could not be reached for comment.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Some artist with his finger on the pulse of American taste has made <a href="http://www.caplakesting.com/2006_catalog/de/index.htm">a sculpture of Britney Spears, nude, giving birth</a> (NVSFW)&#8212;a sculpture which &#8220;reveals the crowning of baby Sean’s head&#8221; and &#8220;also acknowledges the pop-diva’s pin-up past by showing Spears seductively posed on all fours atop a bearskin rug with back arched, pelvis thrust upward, as she clutches the bear’s ears&#8230;&#8221;</p>
	<p>Free advice to any pregnant women out there who might take a statue of Ms. Spears as a role model: in the early stages of labor, if your baby is <a href="http://webcenter.health.webmd.netscape.com/NR/rdonlyres/8230169D-F910-4B89-BE8C-C6E482D28309.gif">sunny-side up</a>, this posture can make you more comfortable and maybe convince the kid to roll over.  Once the baby is ready to come out, all-fours can be a good position to push from, but <em>not</em> with your pelvis in the air like a bitch in heat. Unless, of course, you are enjoying the contractions so much that you want to push the baby <em>against</em> the force of gravity.</p>
	<p>P.S.: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_spears#2004.E2.80.932005:_Career_hiatus_and_family">According to Wikipedia</a>, the actual Spears baby was delivered by an elective C-section.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m in the middle of moving ropine.com services from the old G4 in our basement to a virtual server at <a href="http://openhosting.com/home">OpenHosting</a>.  (Virtual hosting is cheap enough these days that a cheap virtual server plus a cheap DSL line costs less than the static-IP DSL line that we have now.)</p>
	<p>The first thing I moved over was the email. In the past, I&#8217;ve turned up my nose at <a href="http://sendmail.com/">sendmail</a>, because although it&#8217;s the traditional Unix <acronym title="Mail Transfer Agent">MTA</acronym>, it&#8217;s been <a href="http://cr.yp.to/maildisasters/sendmail.html">a poster child for insecure code</a>. But OpenHosting comes with sendmail already set up, and I was tired of all the effort it took to get my MTA and my spam filter and my IMAP server to make nice to one another, and I decided to take advantage of whatever my ISP and its Linux distribution had done to make my life easier. (I am coming to the realization, in my old age, that every hour spent <em>administering</em> my computer is an hour I don&#8217;t spend <em>using</em> it.) And besides, sendmail hadn&#8217;t had any embarrassing security holes in a while.</p>
	<p>So imagine my delight to see <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/176596/">an article on LWN.net</a> that begins: &#8220;It&#8217;s been a while since we had a good sendmail vulnerability&#8230;but we need wait no longer. <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/176595/">Sendmail 8.13.6</a> has just been released in response to a security issue which could lead to a remote root exploit.&#8221;</p>
	<p>(&#8220;Remote root exploit&#8221; is security-geek shorthand for &#8220;a way for someone who doesn&#8217;t even have an account on your machine to connect to it and take it over&#8221;.)</p>
	<p>Hopefully, if anyone has actually figured out a way to take advantage of this security hole, nobody has yet bothered to use it against <em>me</em> (and if they try now, it&#8217;s too late). But maybe I should go to the trouble of setting up <a href="http://cr.yp.to/qmail.html">qmail</a> or <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">postfix</a> after all.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>In a previous life, I aspired to be a teacher of deaf children. I had to abandon that plan for financial reasons, but not before serving two terms as a student teacher and collecting a master&#8217;s degree in the subject.  A recent posting by <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=siderea">siderea</a> on <a href="http://siderea.livejournal.com/324810.html">Avidity, Giftedness, and the Classroom</a> reminded me of the most depressing experience from my graduate-school years.</p>
	<p>For my first round of student teaching, I worked in a middle-school science class at a school for deaf children. One of the students who passed through that classroom was a girl I&#8217;ll call &#8220;Ellen&#8221;.  Ellen had been born outside the United States; in her country of birth, she had spent a number of years in an oral school (one that only allowed communication through speech and lipreading), and when her family moved to the US, she was placed in a school that used sign language. Even compared with other deaf immigrants, her progress at picking up ASL was very slow.</p>
	<p>But by God, she was <em>avid</em>.  She would tell me stories in a rapid-fire sequence of signs that neither I nor her ASL-fluent classmates could understand. I would set up a game for us to play and she would be eager to play it, although her guesses as to the rules of the game did not always match my intentions. Meanwhile, the other three students in her class would pretty much sit there and wait to be told what to do. I recalled a comment by Maria Montessori in one of her books: mentally retarded children would only use <a href="http://www.montessori-ami-edu.de/montibasis_eng.html">her educational materials</a> when prodded by a teacher, but children of normal intelligence would pick them up on their own initiative.</p>
	<p>I was convinced that Ellen was a bright kid whose intelligence was being masked by a combination of deafness, a deprived educational background (of the sort that is very common among prelingually deaf children), and some kind of language processing disorder. At some point, I must have said something too positive about her to my supervising teacher, because he just <em>went off</em> about how I had to understand that she was retarded: maybe from some kind of organic defect, maybe just as a consequence of her upbringing, but it didn&#8217;t matter now because. She. Is. Retarded.</p>
	<p>As proof of Ellen&#8217;s poor language skills, the teacher described an incident where another student was standing too close to her, and Ellen said <em>&#8220;B/w&#8221;</em> (I&#8217;m transcribing this in <a href="http://www.speakeasy.org/~mamandel/ASCII-Stokoe.html">ASCII-Stokoe notation</a>).</p>
	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a sign,&#8221; I said.  I had seen a Deaf adult use exactly that sign in exactly the same context.</p>
	<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; the teacher said, &#8220;it&#8217;s not a sign, it&#8217;s a gesture.&#8221; And he went on about how he had studied ASL at a certain well-regarded deaf-ed program and knew the difference between a sign and a gesture, and he knew that if Ellen had been using proper ASL, she would have signed <em>&#8220;pb/B&#34;/fx&#8221;</em>.</p>
	<p>(Of course, I checked with Deaf ASL-fluent classmates later that day, and I was right. <em>&#8220;pb/B&#34;/fx&#8221;</em> is the sort of sign you&#8217;d use to describe mailing a letter. Ellen had all sorts of trouble with ASL, but in this respect, she knew more than her teacher.)</p>
	<p>I told the head of my deaf-ed program that I&#8217;d like to have a formal test of ASL fluency administered to Ellen, or at least videotape her telling one of her stories, so that someone who knew ASL backwards and forwards could analyze what was going on with her.  No dice, said the professor. You can&#8217;t test a student without the principal&#8217;s permission.</p>
	<p>So I went on to my next student-teaching assignment, and Ellen&#8230;she&#8217;s in her twenties now, so I assume she&#8217;s now out of high school and in a group home&#8230;for the mentally retarded.</p>
	<p>I wonder how many kids like Ellen someone would encounter in a career of teaching deaf children. Maybe it&#8217;s just as well that I don&#8217;t know.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a certain genre of <a href="http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article.asp?aid=12103069_1">conservative essay</a>, lamenting how today&#8217;s society prevents little boys from growing into <a href="http://www.compleatsteve.com/bits/men.htm">real men</a>. I think I&#8217;ve finally realized why these essays always set my teeth on edge.</p>

	<p>When I was in middle school, I had to endure a lot of malicious teasing from my peers, because I fell way short of twelve-year-old boys&#8217; standards of masculinity: I had no talent for sports, I cried easily, I was introverted, etc., etc. Through four and a half years of <a href="http://web.mit.edu">college with other geeks</a>, I managed to find a niche in a social network of people kinda like myself, and within that network I developed enough social skills that I can deal with people who are not so much like myself.</p>

	<p>These authors are telling me that the boys who made my childhood miserable actually <em>were</em> closer to the masculine ideal than I was:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>The ancient Greeks in particular had ideas about manliness that Mansfield considers instructive for the contemporary mind. Both Plato and Aristotle described an element in the human soul called <em>thumos</em>, a kind of animal spiritedness or “bristling” that vies with our reason, especially in men. <em>Thumos</em>, Mansfield observes, has “no natural end beyond itself.” It is an impulse that must be tamed and trained, channeled into the virtue of manly courage. Even while recognizing the danger of men’s natural assertiveness, the philosophers understood that a good society had to “give it its due.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>From this theory, we can infer that:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>If a boy lacks this unreasonable animal spirit, his peers have a right to insult his masculinity. Real Men have <em>thumos</em>.</li>
		<li>If a boy applies his <em>thumos</em> to, say, <a href="http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2006/01/day-i-got-showered-almost.html">throwing a younger boy in a locker room and soaking him in the showers</a>, this is not <em>good</em>, but boys will be boys, and we can&#8217;t do too much to change them.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Compared with some of the stories I&#8217;ve heard, my treatment in middle school was mild. At least I always felt that the adults around me were on my side. The folks who whinge about The Decline Of True Manhood, by contrast, stand with the bullies.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Last night we saw <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0421239/">Red Eye</a>, an entertaining thriller about a hotel manager who becomes entangled in a plot to assassinate a deputy secretary of Homeland Security.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, at <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060306/ap_on_go_co/homeland_insecurity">the real Department of Homeland Security</a>, former security guards report that the DHS headquarters are, well, insecure. The DHS contracts out (of course) its security to Wackenhut Services, which apparently is subcontracting the DHS account to Maxwell Smart.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>For instance, when an envelope with suspicious powder was opened last fall at Homeland Security Department headquarters, guards said they watched in amazement as superiors carried it by the office of Secretary Michael Chertoff, took it outside and then shook it outside Chertoff&#8217;s window without evacuating people nearby.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Fortunately for Mr. Chertoff, Osama knows as well as I do that even if he knocked out all the top DHS managers in one bold and vicious attack, nobody would notice their absence.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>As every good Orthodox Jew knows, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_Hypothesis">Documentary Hypothesis</a>, the idea that &#8220;R&#8221; wrote the Torah by editing and amending previous writings by &#8220;J&#8221;, &#8220;E&#8221;, &#8220;P&#8221;, and &#8220;D&#8221;, is contrary to Jewish doctrine.</p>
	<p>(You can find <a href="http://www.soncino.com/Hertz_Pentateuch.asp">commentaries by famous rabbis</a> that argue against the Documentary Hypothesis at great length. I never quite understood the point; since God is capable of writing in whatever combination of styles He wants, a proof that the Torah resembles an anthology does not disprove God&#8217;s authorship. But I digress.)</p>
	<p>Most good Orthodox Jews probably <em>don&#8217;t</em> know, however, that <a href="http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2006/03/who-wrote-torah.html">another hypothesis</a>, stating that God wrote the Torah by editing and amending previous writings by Adam, Noah, Abraham, and some of Abraham&#8217;s descendants, has been proposed by an impeccably kosher source.</p>
	<p>P.S.: Best comment to that blog posting:</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I keep seeing articles, both in newspapers and blogs, that have something to do with the right to publish images that are offensive to some religion or another. Most of these have such a dog-bites-man quality that they&#8217;re not worth passing along<sup><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn87255403843fee2477ff63">1</a></sup>, but <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1996/60.html">Wingrove v. The United Kingdom</a> got my attention.</p>
	<p>The United Kingdom has a law against blasphemy, forbidding &#8220;any contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible&#8221;. When <em>The Satanic Verses</em> was published, British Muslims asked that the blasphemy laws be extended to outlaw similar offenses against their religion<sup><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn35860838743fee2478072e">2</a></sup>. The Home Secretary advised those benighted heathen that:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>...an alteration in the law could lead to a rush of litigation which would damage relations between faiths. I hope you can appreciate how divisive and how damaging such litigation might be, and how inappropriate our legal mechanisms are for dealing with matters of faith and individual belief. Indeed, the Christian faith no longer relies on it, preferring to recognise that the strength of their own belief is the best armour against mockers and blasphemers.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Less than three months after the Secretary delivered this paean to free expression, the British Board of Film Classification banned<sup><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn40129200243fee24780efd">3</a></sup> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098604/">Visions of Ecstasy</a>, a short erotic film based on the life of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_of_Avila">St. Teresa of &Aacute;vila</a>, on the grounds that the film was likely to infringe the blasphemy law. After three appeals, the filmmaker&#8217;s dispute with Her Majesty&#8217;s government reached the European Court of Human Rights, which weighed the film board&#8217;s decision against the &#8220;freedom of expression&#8221; article of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a>. Quoth their honors:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>The Court recalls that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society. As paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) expressly recognises, however, the exercise of that freedom carries with it duties and responsibilities. Amongst them, in the context of religious beliefs, may legitimately be included a duty to avoid as far as possible an expression that is, in regard to objects of veneration, gratuitously offensive to others and profanatory&#8230;</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>It&#8217;s great when politicians have the courage to tell a hostile audience, &#8220;The right of free speech extends to these statements that deeply offend me&#8221;.  When they say &#8220;The right of free speech extends to these statements that deeply offend <em>you</em>&#8221;, I&#8217;m not so impressed.</p>
	<p class="fn" id="fn87255403843fee2477ff63"><sup>1</sup> Fundamentalist leaders use accusations of blasphemy to incite violence! Whoda thunk it?</p>
	<p class="fn" id="fn35860838743fee2478072e"><sup>2</sup> The British blasphemy law is not just restricted to Christianity; it&#8217;s restricted to <em>Anglican</em> Christianity. If you want to publish something contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous about the Pope, you&#8217;re in luck.</p>
	<p class="fn" id="fn40129200243fee24780efd"><sup>3</sup> To be pedantic: they refused to grant the movie a classification, even a &#8220;you must be at least 18 to get within ten feet of this video&#8221; classification, and films without classifications from the Board may not be distributed in the UK.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>A while ago, James Carville and Paul Begala <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0603.carville.html">proposed</a>
 a campaign-finance reform that combined a Congressional pay raise with draconian limits on fund-raising.  bellatrys <a href="http://bellatrys.livejournal.com/216105.html">strenuously objected</a> to the first part of this plan, arguing that if you aren&#8217;t willing to serve in Congress for the current rate of $160K plus benefits, you don&#8217;t belong in Washington.  I disagree.</p>
	<p>If you&#8217;re looking to fill a job opening in the private sector, you decide on a pay scale and job requirements; if you can&#8217;t find someone who meets your requirements to work for the scale you offer, then you have to decide whether to raise the pay, lower the standards, or let the position remain open for a while longer. For Congress, we don&#8217;t have that option; any citizen who meets the age and residency requirements, and who gets one vote more than the other guy, gets to sit in the legislature. So how do we know that the country would benefit if members of Congress got a raise?  Here are some clues based on what people get paid for similar work when they don&#8217;t face the embarassment of voting for their own paychecks:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ex-Congresscritters, or even former high-ranking Congressional staffers, can pull in beaucoup bucks as consultants, lobbyists, or law partners. Granted, a big proportion of their salaries depend on the assumption that their contacts can help grease the wheels of legislation. But if someone can be so valuable to General Dynamics or the Carlyle Group <em>after</em> being a member of Congress, shouldn&#8217;t they be as valuable to the country <em>while</em> a member of Congress?  (This is especially true for those folks whose political outlooks are, shall we say, unfriendly to General Dynamics.)</li>
		<li>According to <a href="http://www.careerjournal.com/salaryhiring/industries/law/20051104-associate2-tab.html">the National Association for Law Placement</a>, an associate with six years&#8217; experience at a law firm makes about $165,000 a year, i.e., roughly the same as one of the 535 people responsible for <em>writing</em> the law. Of course, a partner at one of these firms can make far more. An attorney defending a corporation accused of securities fraud can make far more than the SEC lawyers responsible for prosecuting the fraud case (whose salaries are generally capped by the Congressional salary). This seems kind of whacked.</li>
		<li>Look at major-league baseball: there are only 30 teams with 25 players each, competition for a spot on a major league is intense, and thanks to baseball&#8217;s antitrust exemption, the number of baseball teams competing for players remains relatively stable. MLB player salaries <em>start</em> at $300,000.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; you say, &#8220;it wouldn&#8217;t be <em>fair</em> to pay members of Congress so much money.  Heck, it isn&#8217;t fair that a lawyer with six years&#8217; experience makes $165,000 while a teacher with the same experience would be lucky to make a third of that.&#8221;</p>
	<p>No, it&#8217;s not fair.  But that&#8217;s because capitalism is <em>systematically</em> unfair.  Pointing fingers at a few particular beneficiaries of that system and shaming them into accepting a lower wage is not going to reform the system; if anything, it distracts people from reforming the system.  (Look at how readily conservatives <a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/yesh/article/white-liberal-seeks-limousine">sneer at wealthy liberals</a>. Or recall the grumbling, during the recent New York City transit workers&#8217; strike, about how much NYC bus drivers were already being paid.)</p>
	<p>So by all means, let&#8217;s work to reform our economy so it is not so systematically unfair (e.g., by making the income tax more progressive). At the same time, though, when we hire someone to do a job for us, we need to recognize the price that the market has set for that work, and budget accordingly.</p>
	<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; you say, &#8220;a person should be running for Congress out of a sincere desire to serve the public, not because the money is good. If we raise the salary, then there will be more unscrupulous people running for office&#8212;as if we needed any more.&#8221;</p>
	<p>When people have the luxury of choosing which job to apply for, they usually have a mixture of financial and non-financial motives. A brilliant teacher may pass up more lucrative work for the sake of continuing to work with children, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can reduce teachers&#8217; salaries to zero and expect the brilliant ones to stay on. It&#8217;s reasonable to assume that the same is true, in reverse, for public officials: some people out there might run for office if the pay were higher, out of a <em>mixture</em> of wanting the money (or at least, wanting enough money to make up for the suffering they expect on the campaign trail) and a desire for public service.</p>
	<p>Sure, some unscrupulous people will run for office. But if honest people <em>run against</em> the unscrupulous ones, the voters at least have a fighting chance of comparing the records of the candidates and deciding which one is less likely to be scamming them.</p>
	<p>How do we get more honest people to run? First, we need more meaningful campaign finance reform (and I&#8217;m not terribly impressed by the Carville/Begala proposal), so that candidates don&#8217;t have to choose between following their principles and affording to run for re-election. Second, we need&#8230;well&#8230;more people to run. If potential Congresscritters are not entirely immune from the law of supply and demand, then hiking Congressional pay can help with that.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>For a moment there, I actually felt sorry for Microsoft.</p>  <p>Two years ago, the European Union decided that Microsoft was violating the EU&#8217;s antitrust laws, and ordered Microsoft to license and document Windows server protocols, so that other companies could interoperate with Windows.  Microsoft turned over 12,000 pages of technical information, but according to the EU&#8217;s geeks, those documents were &#8220;totally unusable&#8221;.  So instead, Microsoft announced with great fanfare that is was licensing Windows server source code.  You want to know how to write a program for another operating system that can use the special Windows networking protocols?  Just read the Windows source code, and it will all be clear!</p>  <p>(A note to our less technical readers: This is like trying to figure out why your car has started to make that funny metal-grinding-on-metal noise by touring the assembly line and looking for places where two metal parts are installed next to one another. Oh, wait, cars are assembled from components built by outside vendors, so you&#8217;ll need to tour the vendors&#8217; assembly lines, too.)</p>  <p>Reading this, I felt a glimmer of sympathy for Microsoft, because I have had my share of tech jobs in which I had to deal with a horribly convoluted and undocumented system, where every time I needed to figure out What&#8217;s Really Going On Here, I had to choose between asking the guy who knew how the whole system was put together because he put it together himself five years ago and had been maintaining it ever since then (and of course, since he was the only one who knew how the whole system was put together, he was too busy fixing its bugs and shoehorning in new features to spend much time explaining it to anyone else), or reading the source code (see previous comment about touring the assembly line).</p>  <p>And now, we have a whole operating system&#8212;or at least, a major component of an operating system&#8212;that has accreted over at least ten years, without anyone responsible for documenting it and keeping that documentation up to date, and every Microsoftie who&#8217;s had to learn something about its inner workings has learned it by receiving an oral tradition.  (&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re getting <em>that</em> error code?  The last time I got that, I talked to Mike.  He wrote three-quarters of that DLL&#8230;&#8221;) And now, all of a sudden, they need to provide enough documentation that complete strangers can do things with their code that, up until now, were in their exclusive domain.  They don&#8217;t just need a tech writer; they need a tech writer with experience in operating system design, investigative reporting, and archeology.</p>  <p>So, for a moment, I felt sorry for Microsoft.  But then I remembered that Microsoft has <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=MSFT&annual">over 37 <strong>b</strong>illion dollars in the bank</a>, i.e., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_GDP">more than the Gross Domestic Product of Luxembourg</a>.  With that amount of spare change, they should be able to find someone up to the task.</p>  <p class="via"> via <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060125103545406">Groklaw</a> and <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/02/01/1550232">Slashdot</a> </p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>In a much-blogged-about <a href="http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/spiegel/0,1518,druck-392319,00.html">interview</a> with a German magazine, the philosopher Daniel Dennett waxes theological:</p>  <dl> <dt> SPIEGEL </dt> <dd> Another idea of Nietzsche&#8217;s was that God is dead. Is that also a logical conclusion reached by Darwinism? </dd> <dt> Dennett </dt> <dd> It is a very clear consequence. The argument for design, I think, has always been the best argument for the existence of God and when Darwin comes along, he pulls the rug out from under that. </dd> <dt> SPIEGEL </dt> <dd> Evolution, in other words, leaves no room for God? </dd> <dt> Dennett </dt> <dd> One has to understand that God&#8217;s role has been diminished over the eons. First we had God, as you said, making Adam and making every creature with his hands, plucking the rib from Adam and making Eve from that rib. Then we trade that God in for the God who sets evolution in motion. And then you say you don&#8217;t even need that God&#8212;-the law giver&#8212;-because if we take these ideas from cosmology seriously then there are other places and other laws and life evolves where it can. So now we no longer have God the law finder or the law giver, but just God the master of ceremonies. When God is the master of ceremonies and doesn&#8217;t actually play any role any more in the universe, he&#8217;s sort of diminished and no longer intervenes in any way. </dd> </dl>  <p>I find this argument profoundly unconvincing, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s just because I believe in both evolution and God.  Dennett&#8217;s claim can be attacked from a number of angles that the interviewer didn&#8217;t address; I want to focus on two.</p>  <p>First, the idea that God is present in activity that seems mechanical or random is not some kind of fallback position.  The whole Book of Esther, for instance, is a story of God working to save the Jews of Persia through what a skeptic would perceive as mere coincidences. Dennett considers this a &#8220;diminished&#8221; vision of God, compared to a God who is constantly intervening in history with overt miracles.  But this is like saying that Orson Welles is a lesser director than George Lucas, because the special effects in <em>Citizen Kane</em> are not as impressive as those in <em>The Phantom Menace</em>.</p>  <p>Second, one can find fault with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleological_argument">argument from design</a> even without knowing anything about evolutionary theory; David Hume&#8217;s <em>Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</em> were written a century before <em>Origin of Species</em>, and Hume finds several ways to undermine the argument.</p>  <p>It is true that the authority of institutionalized religion went downhill since the theory of evolution became widely accepted, but Dennett is mistaken to believe that the latter is the cause of the former.  Ironically, Dennett&#8217;s argument is the flip-side of a common creationist claim&#8212;-the claim that if you teach people that they evolved from animals, then you teach them that they have no greater moral obligations than animals have.</p>  <p>In the late 19th century, science evolved, pardon the expression, from a hobby of wealthy men to a driving force behind the Industrial Revolution.  Once scientific institutions earned credibility by providing the tools that created such staggering economic growth, people who spoke in the name of Science got respect when they spoke about politics, ethics, and morals.  Unfortunately, people had trouble distinguishing empirically-well-grounded theory from handwaving, so a lot of handwavey ideas got passed off as serious science.  (My favorite handwave is the claim that if a woman develops her brain&#8212;-by, say, attending college&#8212;-her uterus will shrivel up.  This theory is firmly grounded in the Law of Conservation of Energy, one of the great discoveries of nineteenth-century physics; who could deny it?)</p>  <p>As scientific institutions gained influence over public policy, religious institutions could only lose.  I would suggest that this resentment over lost status has motivated the fundamentalist movement, in the past and in the present.  Accepting the theory of evolution does not require one to reject religion in general.  Rather, it requires one to reject <em>a certain kind</em> of religion: the kind that arose as a specific reaction against the modern science-driven world.</p>  <p class="via"> via <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/dennett_on_intelligent_design.html">Joho the Blog</a> and <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/dennett_interview_in_spiegel_online/">Pharyngula</a> </p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Some thoughts inspired by <a href="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/051220_kitzmiller_342.pdf"><em>Kitzmiller v. Dover</em></a>:</p>  <p>Suppose you are walking through a field and you find a watch.  As every student of theology knows, once you see the watch, you know there must have been a watchmaker.  But that&#8217;s not <em>all</em> you know. You can look at the brand name and determine what company made the watch, and then you&#8217;ll know where you could go to get another watch like it, and you could even estimate how much it would cost.  If you&#8217;re a horologist, you might be able to figure out when the watch was made.  If you&#8217;re a customs inspector, you might be able to tell if the watch labeled &#8220;Rolex&#8221; is a real Rolex or a counterfeit.</p>  <p>In every field where people examine sapient-created artifacts, the examiners want to <em>learn about</em> the creators, not just confirm their existence.  Historians analyzed <em>The Federalist Papers</em> to determine which documents were written by which Founding Father.  An archaeologist who finds a stone blade will try to determine what it was used for and when it was made.  A homicide detective wants to identify the perpetrator.</p>  <p>One of the basic propositions of Intelligent Design Theory is that while &#8220;microevolution&#8221; takes place, &#8220;macroevolution&#8221; is a fiction created by those wily Darwinists.  Walter Brown of the Center for Scientific Creation distinguishes micro- and macroevolution by saying that the latter <a href="http://www.creationscience.com/LifeSciences2.html">&#8220;requires new abilities, increasing complexity, and new genetic information&#8221;</a>. If a baterial strain develops resistance to an antibiotic, does that count as a &#8220;new ability&#8221;?  Of course not, says <a href="http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq/articles/41/41_4/bact_resist.htm">a recent article in the <em>Creation Science Research Quarterly</em></a>, because a strain that gains resistance to an antibiotic usually loses some other quality, such as virulence.  But by that logic, <em>any</em> change in an organism&#8217;s traits can be dismissed as &#8220;microevolution&#8221;, since any change has both benefits and costs. (Humans have bigger brains than apes.  The benefit is that we can think of solutions to problems that apes can&#8217;t solve.  The cost is that in order to fit our skulls through our mothers&#8217; pelvises at birth, we are born premature by primate standards, and we depend on the care of adults for a longer period of time.)</p>  <p>Suppose, for the purpose of argument, that there is a meaningful distinction between micro- and macroevolution, and that the latter does not occur.  Given two organisms, how can we tell whether or not they have a common ancestor?  At what point would they become just dissimilar enough to be classified in separate trees?  <a href="http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq/articles/37/37_2/baraminology.htm">This <em><span class="caps">CSRQ</span></em> article</a> goes on at great length about &#8220;the ten-year-old field of baraminology&#8221; (the term is derived from the Hebrew &#x05d1;&#x05e8;&#x05d0; &#x05de;&#x05d9;&#x05df;, &#8220;He created a type&#8221;), defining the terms &#8220;holobaramin&#8221;, &#8220;monobaramin&#8221;, &#8220;apobaramin&#8221;, &#8220;polybaramin&#8221;, &#8220;archebaramin&#8221;, &#8220;neobaramin&#8221;, and &#8220;paleobaramin&#8221;, without answering this question.</p>  <p>Instead of performing this kind of actual research, creationists focus on packaging themselves for school boards.  First we had outright Biblical creationism taught in taxpayer-funded schools.  When the Supreme Court declared that unconstitutional, we had &#8220;creation science&#8221;.  When the courts remained unconvinced by the renaming, &#8220;Intelligent Design Theory&#8221; burst onto the scene, and to make sure the theory was not challenged as unscientific, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/EDUCATION/11/08/evolution.debate.ap/">the Kansas Board of Education redefined &#8220;science&#8221;</a>.</p>  <p>It&#8217;s as if a police department, frustrated by accusations that they were not solving enough murder cases, declared every case closed as soon as they classified it as a homicide, and didn&#8217;t bother to actually look for the murderer.  We wouldn&#8217;t put up with that kind of laziness from our police; we shouldn&#8217;t teach our children that the same attitude is acceptable from a scientist.</p>  <p class='via'> for the contrary view, see <i>Cross-Currents</i>: <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2005/12/21/bad-arguments-bad-decision/">1</a> <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2005/12/22/rabbi-avi-shafran-on-intelligent-design/">2</a> <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2005/12/25/the-courts-contempt/">3</a> <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2005/12/26/rabbi-shafran-responds/">4</a> <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2005/12/29/the-sisson-memo-reprise/">5</a> </p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>After reading several references to Philip Pullman&#8217;s <cite>His Dark Materials</cite> series as a riposte to the <cite>Narnia</cite> series, Jen and I decided that we had to read it. I enjoyed the series a lot&#8212;probably because I was able to pretend that when the good guys delivered their speeches on the evils of God and the Church, they were characters expressing opinions about other characters, and any correspondence between the bad guys in the book and deities, mythological systems, or religious institutions in the real world were <em>purely</em> coincidental. <p>I probably <em>should</em> be annoyed that Pullman inverts a Christian rhetorical trope going back (at least) to Pascal&#8217;s Wager, i.e., you have to either believe in the Christian God or be an atheist. Lyra&#8217;s world, from what Pullman shows of it, lacks Episcopalians and Lutherans, let alone Jews and Muslims; he seems to be agreeing with the Christians about what his options are and merely disagreeing on which side to join. But for some reason, that didn&#8217;t bother me while I was reading the book.</p> <p>There was a detail that <em>did</em> irritate me a little, but describing it involves some minor spoilers, so I&#8217;m putting it below the fold&#8230;</p> <p>The villians of the series, except for the priests, are distinguished from the heroes by acting on their sexual desire. The closest thing we have to a love scene is toward the end of <cite>The Subtle Knife</cite>, where Mrs.&nbsp;Coulter seduces Lord Boreal into giving her information about the knife, and then poisons him before they actually endanger the book&#8217;s &#8220;Young Adult&#8221; classification. (Coulter goes over to the good guys by the end of the series, but she still gets the traditional fate of Loose Women in Western literature, i.e., death.) We are told that Metatron, the most powerful of the angels on the Authority&#8217;s side, had sex with numerous human women.</p> <p>By contrast, Will and Lyra enter the story as preadolescents, and while they fall in love, they don&#8217;t have anything more explicit than romantic walks through the forest. John Parry stoically endures years of separation from his wife, and is killed by the witch from Lyra&#8217;s world whose love he did not requite. Mary Malone left her religious order because she realized she wanted to the freedom to enjoy the pleasures of this world, but like the Protestant husband in <cite>Monty Python&#8217;s The Meaning of Life</cite>, there&#8217;s no sign she has <em>used</em> this freedom to seek out a lover.</p> <p>So for Pullman, there&#8217;s no heavenly reward for a life of chastity, but you still shouldn&#8217;t have sex. Englishmen. Go figure.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve been very very good parents, so our children let us go out a date last week, and we saw the <cite>Narnia</cite> movie. <p>Jen has already posted <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/lucretia_borgia/19339.html">her own review</a>. My disorganized comments:</p> <ul> <li>What strikes me the most about this movie is the emphasis placed on how Peter belittled Edmund, and the clear implication that Peter is partly responsible for Edmund&#8217;s decision to <strike>go over to the Dark Side</strike> <strike>use the Ring of Power</strike> cooperate with the White Witch. In the book, by contrast, the narrator describes Edmund as &#8220;spiteful&#8221; without reference to any psychological cause; sibling rivalry is mentioned later in the book, but it seems to play a much less significant role. (To be fair, Edmund is not exactly an autonomous moral agent in the book, either, seeing as how the Witch spiked his Turkish Delight with crystal meth.) If this is how the screenwriters reinterpret Edmund Pevensie, I shudder to imagine what they&#8217;ll do with Eustace Clarence Scrubb.</li> <li>In the Witch&#8217;s first encounter with Edmund, Tilda Swinton did an excellent job portraying someone who is used to ruling through fear, but just once needs to get her way through charm. The rest of the acting is&#8230; well&#8230; good enough for the characters being portrayed, who have about as much depth as wading pools.</li> <li>Not that I have a vested interest, but I have trouble seeing <cite>Narnia</cite> as a vehicle to convert the under-18 masses to Christianity. If I understand correctly, a Christian evangelist is supposed to convince you that <em>because</em> Jesus died for your sins, you should change your attitudes and behavior (the details of the desired change depend on which Christian denomination you&#8217;re talking to). But in this movie, there&#8217;s no &#8220;because&#8221;. Since the children are aliens to this &#8220;Old Magic&#8221; that prescribed Edmund&#8217;s blood-guilt in the first place, it doesn&#8217;t have the same emotional impact as the corresponding lectures from Paul of Tarsus. There&#8217;s no analog of the Sermon on the Mount or any other scene in which Aslan is telling his followers how they should be acting. Peter, Susan, and Lucy, who revered Aslan as soon as they heard his name, don&#8217;t seem to have a different emotional relationship with him after his resurrection. You certainly don&#8217;t see anyone suggesting that just as Aslan saved Edmund from the punishment rightfully due to him, a good Narnian should offer the Witch&#8217;s underlings parole rather than death.</li> </ul> <p>P.S.: Speaking of the <cite>Narnia</cite> series, Andrew Rilstone has <a href="http://andrewrilstone.blogspot.com/2005/11/lipstick-on-my-scholar.html">an interesting essay</a> defending Lewis&#8217;s much-commented-on portrayal of Susan in <cite>The Last Battle</cite>.</p></p>]]>

Then say, &#8220;This locket is handmade from precious metal &#8211; just the way God made you. This locket and what it stands for is the sentinel of your heart. Here&#8217;s why: from this day forward you will wear this locket as often as you wish. It will send the statement that you are waiting for your husband. It is more than that though, Sue. It has a lock on it. It can only be opened with this key. I will guard the key until your wedding. On that day, I will present the key to my little girl&#8217;s heart to your husband. He will take the key and open the locket, the only one ever to do so.&#8221;</blockquote> <p>This is why we need sex education in the public schools.

<![CDATA[<p>When Joseph Hanas was pled guilty to marijuana possession, the judge placed him in a special rehab program, run by a Pentecostal church. <a href="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051206/METRO/512060440">The <i>Detroit News</i></a> tells what happened next: <blockquote> <p>Hanas said the program did not offer drug treatment or counseling, nor did it have any organized program other than reading the Bible and attending Pentecostal services.</p> <p>He said his rosary and prayer book was taken from him and his religion was denounced as &#8220;witchcraft.&#8221; Hanas said he was told his only chance of avoiding prison and a felony record was to convert to the Pentecostal faith.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hanas is suing to have his conviction set aside, and the <abbr title="American Civil Liberties Union"><span class="caps">ACLU</span></abbr> is helping him out.</p> <p>Since the plaintiff is a Catholic who is protesting a state-funded coercive conversion to a Protestant faith&#8212;they used to fight wars over this kind of thing&#8212;you might think that the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, <a href="http://www.catholicleague.org/faqs.htm">&#8220;the nation&#8217;s largest Catholic civil rights organization&#8221;</a>, would take an interest.

<![CDATA[<p>Rabbi <i>[sic]</i> Aryeh Spero, envisioning <a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=10444">a dystopian future America in which saying &#8220;Christmas&#8221; is outlawed</a>: <blockquote>&ldquo;Some of the people who stood up against the ACLU,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;were called Conservatives. In those days, you weren&rsquo;t welcomed in &lsquo;progressive&rsquo; circles if you were a Conservative. You didn&rsquo;t get those high-paying jobs in the media, Hollywood, or in the University. In fact, if they knew you were Conservative, you could even lose your job&#8212;and, if you wanted to keep your job, you had to undergo diversity training at Sensitivity Sessions and mouth the appropriate platitudes and apologies, even against your own conscience.&rdquo;</blockquote> <p>The Associated Press, describing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/national/AP-Creationism-Class.html">the present America</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>A University of Kansas religion professor apologized for an e-mail that referred to religious conservatives as &#8220;fundies&#8221; and said a course describing intelligent design as mythology would be a &#8220;nice slap in their big fat face.&#8221;</p> <p>In a written apology Monday, Paul Mirecki, chairman of the university&#8217;s Religious Studies Department, said he would teach the planned class &#8220;as a serious academic subject and in an manner that respects all points of view.&#8221;</p> <p>The department faculty approved the course Monday but changed its title. The course, originally called &#8220;Special Topics in Religion: Intelligent Design, Creationisms and other Religious Mythologies,&#8221; will instead be called &#8220;Intelligent Design and Creationism.&#8221;</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="http://www.penguinputnam.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,0_1595230165,00.html">The backlash against religion-neutral holiday greetings</a> simply astounds me. Contrast: During the spring, I don&#8217;t see random strangers wishing me a happy Passover, or asking my child what present he&#8217;s hoping to get in exchange for the <i>afikoman</i>. Despite this inattention, <a href="http://www.ujc.org/content_display.html?ArticleID=83795">two-thirds of Jews attend Passover <i>sedarim</i></a>. But if you suggest that it&#8217;s not appropriate to say &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221; to your heathen customers, the wingnuts whine about the Atheist Inquisition coming to town. Of course, if the wingnuts weren&#8217;t gnashing their teeth over this imagined insult to their faith, they might notice that God&#8217;s Own Party lost interest in some of their particular concerns (Federal Marriage Amendment? What&#8217;s that?) as soon as it was safely re-elected, or that some of God&#8217;s Own Politicians <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/007121.php">need to review Deuteronomy 16:19</a>.</p> <p>P.S.: No, Virginia, it really is not appropriate to say &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221; to someone who will not be celebrating it, and I don&#8217;t care how many <a href="http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/jeffjacoby/2004/12/20/14002.html">other Jews</a> tell you it&#8217;s OK. It&#8217;s like being introduced to someone named &#8220;Michael&#8221; and calling him &#8220;Mike&#8221;, without bothering to find out if he actually uses that nickname.

<![CDATA[<p>The <i>Kiddush</i> for Friday night contains the sentence &#8220;&#1499;&#1497; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1514;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; &#1500;&#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497; &#1511;&#1493;&#1491;&#1513; &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; &#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;&#1514; &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;&#8221;. Artscroll translates this as &#8220;For that day is the prologue to the holy convocations, a memorial of the Exodus from Egypt&#8221;. <p>I hear you scratching your head and saying, &#8220;What does Shabbat have to do with the Exodus?&#8221; Fortunately, according to the Artscroll footnote, Nachmanides had the same question, and he explained that Shabbat, representing God&#8217;s creation, is &#8220;the backdrop of the Exodus&#8221;, God&#8217;s demonstration of His ability to intervene in nature.</p> <p>However, the <a href="http://nevarech.co.il/Pages_52-53.html">Nevarech</a> bentscher translates the same sentence as &#8220;a day preceding even those sacred occasions commemorating the departure from Egypt&#8221;, which moots the whole question. All the translator did to reach that interpretation is to rearrange the parse tree a little bit&#8212;treating &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; &#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;&#1514; &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; as a modifier to &#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497; &#1511;&#1493;&#1491;&#1513; rather than to &#1497;&#1493;&#1501;. <strike>And I don&#8217;t see anything in the phrasing or the punctuation to prove that one of these parse trees is better than the other. (<a href="http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-download_wiki_attachment.php?attId=193#s3">Lojban</a> enthusiasts, please take note.)</strike> This is somewhat forced, since &#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497; &#1511;&#1493;&#1491;&#1513; is plural and &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; &#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;&#1514; &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; is singular. Maybe the translators know a loophole in the grammar that I don&#8217;t; can you treat the &#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497; as some sort of collective that takes a singular modifier?</p> <p>But every other <i>Kiddush</i> translation I&#8217;ve seen interprets the sentence the way Artscroll does. So if the <i>Nevarech</i> translation is consistent with the Hebrew text and makes more sense, why don&#8217;t any other translators parse it that way?</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>So there&#8217;s this <a href="http://www.plotpatents.com/about_us.htm">engineer turned patent lawyer</a>, a devotee of Ayn Rand who &#8220;occasionally dabble[s] in fiction&#8221;. Realizing that he has no talent for telling stories, he concludes that his true genius is for coming up with plot lines for stories that other people can tell. <p>Copyright law, the system that has satisfied other literary creators for the past few centuries, would not give this brilliant young man his just reward. Even if he copyrighted a story with one of his brilliant plots, someone else with <em>mere</em> storytelling talent could write another book with essentially the same plot, change enough details to avoid violating the copyright, and walk off with millions.</p> <p>Fortunately, our hero has a solution: patent his plot! Applying his crackerjack legal talents, he writes <a href="http://plotpatents.com/legal_analysis.htm">an essay</a> arguing that patentable plots is a logical application of recent precedents in American patent law. Furthermore, he argues, if such patents are granted, the change in the law &#8220;will spur an array of never-seen-before, never-experienced-before, intellectually inspiring forms of entertainment&#8221;, perhaps involving novel combinations of genetically engineered bacteria, one-click commerce, <a href="http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2004/03/if_wishes_were_.html">and a pony</a>.</p> <p>(OK, at this point, I&#8217;m having trouble figuring out how to get my readers to suspend their disbelief, even for a parody like this. A patentable process is supposed to be not only original and non-obvious, but <em>useful</em>. Even if you think software patents are a blight on the American legal system, it&#8217;s hard to deny that, say, public-key encryption <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=4,405,829">[US Patent 4,405,829]</a> is <em>useful</em>. But how is a patent examiner supposed to distinguish a useful plot from a non-useful one?)</p> <p>Putting his application fees where is mouth is, our hero applies for <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PG01&s1=knight.IN.&s2=plot&OS=IN/knight+AND+plot&RS=IN/knight+AND+plot">a patent</a> on &#8220;A process of relaying a story having a timeline and a unique plot involving characters comprises: indicating a character&#8217;s desire at a first time in the timeline for at least one of the following: a) to remain asleep or unconscious until a particular event occurs; and b) to forget or be substantially unable to recall substantially all events during the time period from the first time until a particular event occurs; indicating the character&#8217;s substantial inability at a time after the occurrence of the particular event to recall substantially all events during the time period from the first time to the occurrence of the particular event; and indicating that during the time period the character was an active participant in a plurality of events.&#8221;</p> <p>(If you have trouble substantially recalling the sentence you just read, don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;ll rewrite it in the next draft.)</p> <p>I&#8217;m not yet sure how this story should end. The options I can think of so far are:</p> <ol> <li>The patent is denied, and the applicant spends the next few decades ranting about the unfairness of it all on Usenet.</li> <li>The patent is granted, but our protagonist can&#8217;t find anyone interested in licensing it. He finally hires a ghostwriter to embody his patented plot in a novel, and has the novel published by a vanity press. It sells about fifty copies.</li> <li>The patent is granted, and the industry takes notice. Within two years, every Hollywood studio and New York publishing house boasts about the size of its patent portfolio. Within five years, American cultural production has ground to a screeching halt; like <a href="http://www.idlewords.com/2003/12/100_years_of_turbulence.htm">the Wright brothers</a>, everyone is too busy angling for the best licensing deal, or tying up their competitors with litigation, to actually publish a new book or distribute a new movie. Americans resort to bootleg films from India.</li> </ol> Can anyone help me out here? I&#8217;ll credit you as a co-<strike>inventor</strike>author. <p class="via">via <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20051103183218268">Groklaw</a> and <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/04/0239221&tid=155&tid=17">Slashdot</a></p></p>]]>

Instead, she has stated that this statute merely inhibited abortions to &#8216;some degree.&#8217; In dissent in Matheson, Justice Marshall argued that the statute would result in substantial interference with abortions sought by minors.

Of the potentially affected women who could not invoke an exception, it seems safe to assume that some percentage, despite an initial inclination not to tell their husbands, would notify their husbands without suffering substantial ill effects.&#8221; <a href="http://www.confirmthem.com/?p=1764#comment-62642"><i>(Planned Parenthood v.

For example, Congress did not find that public employers refused to permit as much sick leave as the FMLA mandates with the intent of disadvantaging employees of one gender&#8230;. Moreover, even if there were relevant findings or evidence, the FMLA provisions at issue here would not be congruent or proportional. Unlike the Equal Protection Clause, which the FMLA is said to enforce, the FMLA does much more than require nondiscriminatory sick leave practices; it creates a substantive entitlement to sick leave.&#8221; (<a href="http://laws.lp.findlaw.com/3rd/003140.html">Chittister v.

The plaintiffs, however, do not appear to have offered any evidence showing how many (or indeed that any actual women) would be affected by this asserted imperfection in the statute&#8230;. The plaintiffs offered evidence that &#8216;mere notification of pregnancy is frequently a flashpoint for battering&#8217;. This proof indicates when violence is likely to occur in an abusive marriage but provides no basis for determining how many women would be adversely affected by Section 3209.&#8221; <a href="http://www.confirmthem.com/?p=1764#comment-62642"><i>(Planned Parenthood v.

They confronted the officers, and while there was some scuffling, the most serious incidents occurred when one young man threw a caustic liquid, probably ammonia, into the eyes of a police cameraman, and another tossed urine on a female police officer and paint on a senior commander.&#8221; [Emphasis added.]</p> <p>Apparently, for these folks, Jews who want to obey laws passed by a democratically elected government <em>of Jews</em> are part of the problem.

<![CDATA[<p>Two and a half years ago, after I was laid off, I had the search engines send me a daily list of every job posting in the Boston area containing the words &#8220;Perl&#8221; or &#8220;Java&#8221;. Virtually nobody wanted to hire a Perl programmer, and virtually every Java position required not only Java, but <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/index.jsp" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog"><abbr title="Java 2, Enterprise Edition">J2EE</abbr></a>; not only <abbr>J2EE</abbr>, but experience with a particular brand of <abbr>J2EE</abbr> application server. I had worked with Java in my previous position, but not <abbr>J2EE</abbr>, so I stayed unemployed for ten months.</p> <p>While I was pounding the electronic pavement, I decided to submit to the discipline of the free market, so I signed up for <a href="http://www.javapassion.com/j2ee/index.html" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">a free online course taught by someone at Sun</a> and downloaded the Linux version of Sun&#8217;s <abbr>J2EE</abbr> reference platform. After a few sessions of learning the arcana of the <abbr title="Enterprise Java Beans"><span class="caps">EJB</span></abbr>, I told my wife: &#8220;Now I understand why they have all these positions for <abbr>J2EE</abbr> programmers. Something a Perl hacker can do in an hour, a team of <abbr>J2EE</abbr> programmers have to spend a week on.&#8221;</p> <p>Developers&#8217; backlash against <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog/2003/11/17" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">the complexity of <abbr>J2EE</abbr></a> is now in full swing, and it seems to be taking two forms. Some people are pushing for expanded use of lighter-weight Java frameworks, such as <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/4.html" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">Hibernate</a>. Others are arguing that the proper solution is to abandon Java altogether, and work with more dynamic languages&#8212;a proposal that has sparked <a href="http://technorati.com/search/%22ruby%20on%20rails%22%20j2ee?language=en" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">much debate</a>, and inspired <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2005/06/23/trails.html" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">a Java framework that&#8217;s even simpler than Hibernate</a>. I can&#8217;t boast years of experience implementing the high-traffic database-intensive Web applications, but I have reason to believe that the dynamic-language folks are on the right track.</p> <p>Suppose you&#8217;re writing a Java component to extract information from a relational database and construct objects appropriate for some other application. The classical way to do the job is to write the <em>procedure</em>, in Java code, to extract fields from the result set and construct your objects. <abbr>J2EE</abbr> and its competing frameworks give you an alternative: you can write a <em>description</em> of how database fields map onto your objects, and let the framework generate code that does the translation for you.</p> <p>The authors of your framework have no way of knowing in advance what classes you would be using in your business logic or what schema your database tables would have. The only way they can connect one to the other is by exploiting loopholes in the Java static typing system: for example, <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/16.html#A5" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog"><abbr>J2EE</abbr> <span class="caps">CMP</span> systems generate code, while Hibernate uses reflection at run-time</a>. The more your object-relational mapping diverges from &#8220;one database row equals one object&#8221;, the greater the flux through those loopholes.</p> <p>So you need to look at how your architecture is split up between the business logic, the persistence layer, and the mapping, and ask yourself: given that the mapping layer has to work around one of the fundamental traits of Java, its type system, do you really benefit from having a mapping layer that&#8217;s implemented <em>in Java?</em></p> <p>You might answer, &#8220;because <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=iG1&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aunofficial&amp;q=%22we%27re+a+java+shop%22&amp;btnG=Search" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">we&#8217;re a Java shop</a>.&#8221; But when you&#8217;re sweating over the proper contents of <span class="caps">XML</span> configuration files, or writing annotations for a tool that <a href="http://xdoclet.sourceforge.net/xdoclet/index.html" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">&#8220;generates 85% of the code for you&#8221;</a>, you&#8217;re not writing Java. So if you expect to be stuck writing a lot of not-Java, you might as well survey all your options, and see which not-Java is best for your needs. Even if your business logic is thousands of lines of Java code, you can still use a more dynamic language for the mapping layer and use <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jni/index.html" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog"><span class="caps">JNI</span></a>, wrappers like <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/11/07/java.html" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">Perl&#8217;s Inline::Java module</a>, or <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog"><span class="caps">JSR</span> 223</a>, when it becomes available, to talk to your business objects&#8217; factories.</p> <p>In the above paragraphs, I keep using the word &#8220;database&#8221;, but the same logic applies to <span class="caps">LDAP</span> directories, <span class="caps">MQS</span>eries messages, <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests, and <span class="caps">XML</span> documents&#8212;all of which have some kind of structure whose variations (a)&nbsp;depend on the application they are used for and (b)&nbsp;are not constrained by the type system of whatever code ends up processing them. Yet, if you read the <abbr>J2EE</abbr> documentation to glean some non-<a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2005-April/000772.html" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">cynical</a> definition of what the &#8220;Enterprise&#8221; is all about, you would conclude that the stunning complexity of <abbr>J2EE</abbr>, and the five-figure price for its application servers, is what you need to integrate your Java code with <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/tutorial/doc/IntroXML.html#wp66013" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog"><span class="caps">XML</span> files</a>, <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/tutorial/doc/WebApp.html#wp76431" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">Web servers</a>, <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/tutorial/doc/EJBConcepts4.html#wp79826" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">databases</a>, and <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/tutorial/doc/EJBConcepts5.html#wp79967" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">messaging systems</a>.

A girl crush, if you&#8217;re too lazy to read the article, is what happens when a straight woman has feelings of infatuation, completely nonsexual feelings, mind you, for another woman, and you shouldn&#8217;t think that she&#8217;s a lesbian for having these feelings. One of the women quoted in the article used the word &#8220;sexy&#8221; twice to describe her admiration for a colleague, but she must be regarding her co-worker as sexy in a strictly Platonic sense.</p> <p>What struck me about the article&#8212;aside from the author&#8217;s apparent hangups&#8212;was this line: &#8220;Social scientists suspect such emotions are part of women&#8217;s nature, feelings that evolution may have favored because they helped women bond with one another and work cooperatively.&#8221;</p> <blockquote> <p><i>Scene: Somewhere in Africa, 100,000 years ago. Two women are digging for yams.</i></p> <p><b>Uggah:</b> Hey, umm, Squeak, there&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been meaning to tell you for a while.</p> <p><b>Squeak:</b> What?</p> <p><b>Uggah:</b> I just want you to know how much I really like you. When you were picking berries a few days ago, I was really impressed by how confident you were about which ones were ready to pick and which ones weren&#8217;t ripe, and I looked at how your fingers were holding the berries and&#8212;you know&#8212;like&#8212;I think you&#8217;re a really cool person and I want to be your friend.</p> <p><i>Pause.</i></p> <p><b>Squeak:</b> Uggah, that&#8217;s really sweet of you.</p> <p><b>Uggah:</b> I mean I want to be your friend in a totally non-sexual kind of way. I don&#8217;t want you to think I&#8217;m a dyke or anything.</p> <p><b>Squeak:</b> No, I don&#8217;t think that at all. I want to be your friend, too.</p> <p><i>Uggah smiles shyly and returns to her digging. Squeak looks out to the horizon and sees a band of mightily thewed single male hunters, dragging a carcass behind them.</i></p> <p><b>Squeak:</b> Hey, Ug? Can you do me a favor?</p> <p><b>Uggah:</b> Sure. What?</p> <p><b>Squeak:</b> It&#8217;s starting to get cold here. Can you run back to my hut and get a couple of blankets?</p> <p><b>Uggah:</b> I&#8217;d be glad to.</p> <p><b>Squeak:</b> I&#8217;d do it myself, but we&#8217;re so far from camp, and I have such a sore back from all this&#8212;</p> <p><b>Uggah:</b> It&#8217;s no problem. Really.</p> <p><i>Squeak watches Uggah until the other woman is a few hundred yards away. Then Squeak brushes back her hair, faces the approaching hunters, and watches them as she digs, leaning forward to show them her cleavage.</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Pop quiz for aspiring evolutionary psychologists: which character in this drama is going to leave more copies of her genome behind?</p> <p class="via">via <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/rm/510025.html" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">rm</a></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee held <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearing.cfm?id=1579" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">hearings</a> on whether or not to pass a Federal law giving journalists the right to keep their sources confidential. The people who spoke in favor of this law were right to say that freedom of the press is one of the fundamental principles of our democracy, and laws that promote this freedom are Good Things. However, a system of checks and balances is <em>another</em> fundamental principle of our democracy, and judging from the remarks made at the hearing, the sponsors of the Federal shield bill are not giving that principle its due.</p> <p>Consider the privileges granted to a lawyer. The Sixth Amendment grants a criminal defendant the right &#8220;to have the assistance of counsel for his defense&#8221;; the ability to speak with a lawyer in confidence is obviously an important aspect of this right. But you can&#8217;t just put &#8220;lawyer&#8221; on your business card and enjoy all the legal immunities of an attorney. The <em>license</em> to practice law is granted by the state, and someone who violates the professional standards of the bar can lose that license. There is no comparable licensing scheme for journalists.</p> <p>Furthermore, not every conversation between a lawyer and client is privileged. If I tell my attorney that I cheated on my taxes, she can&#8217;t be compelled to reveal what I said to a court. But if I ask her to <em>help me cheat on my taxes</em>, and she complies, then our conversation is unprivileged. Witnesses at last week&#8217;s hearing expressed sympathy and support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Miller_%28journalist%29" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">Judith Miller</a>, who chose to go to prison rather than snitch on her source. But if her source was sharing classified information with her, then Miller was <em>abetting a crime</em>, like a lawyer advising a client how to cheat the IRS.</p> <p>Why are members of the Senate <em>Judiciary</em> Committee so eager to give reporters a greater license to secrecy than their fellow lawyers have? Inquiring minds want to know. If some mole on the Senate staff has access to confidential documents that will answer my question&#8230;you know how to find me.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>In a few months, God willing, a new rabbi will be installed at <a href="http://ktm.shuls.net/" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">our humble synagogue</a>, culminating a year-long search for someone to succeed <a href="http://ktm.shuls.net/Shul/rabbi/rabbi.cfm" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">our rabbi of thirty-nine years</a>. When I served on the first rabbinic-search committee (more on that later), I contributed one question to our List of Things To Ask:</p> <blockquote> <p>Suppose you had been a pulpit rabbi when Baruch Goldstein <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Goldstein" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">did that thing in Ma`arat ha-Makhpelah</a>. On the following Shabbat, how would you have addressed the issue with your congregation?</p> </blockquote> <p>There are many disputes of Jewish law where I&#8217;m happy to acknowledge that there are multiple points of view, let a rabbi that I trust answer my own questions, and not care that other people get different answers from the rabbis that they trust. May I eat food with a <a href="http://www.trianglek.org/" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">triangle-K</a> hekhsher? At what minute does the fast on Tisha b&#8217;Av end? How do I handle going to a family event on Shabbat where my wife and I are the only observant Jews present? On the Goldstein question, however, my tolerance for pluralism runs out. According to a faction of dangerous zealots, he was preventing a mass murder; according to everyone with sense, he was committing one. (I trust I have made my bias sufficiently clear.) Nobody who belongs to the second group should call a member of the first group &#8220;my rabbi&#8221;.</p> <p>Furthermore, in my experience, both support and disdain for Goldstein is spread out all over the spectrum of contemporary Orthodoxy; you can&#8217;t infer how a rabbi stands on the issue from the color of his hat or his attitude regarding women&#8217;s prayer groups. So you have to ask, and you have to ask without telegraphing the answer you&#8217;re looking for.</p> <p>All I wanted, when I added this question to our list, was a litmus test to weed out people I absolutely didn&#8217;t want our shul to hire. I got something much better. The <em>way</em> that candidates answered the question&#8212;the way they connected the Goldstein massacre to their own personal history, or to issues in the general Jewish community&#8212;told us things about their personality and priorities that we didn&#8217;t get from the standard interview questions.</p> <p>So, Gentle Reader, if you ever serve on a rabbinic-search committee for an Orthodox synagogue, I strongly encourage you to ask The Goldstein Question to everyone you interview.</p> <p>(I also encourage you to endorse the candidate that is most likely to win approval from a large majority of the congregation he will serve, and not the candidate whom you personally believe would be the best person for the synagogue. That, you see, is why our shul had <em>two</em> rabbinic search committees, and why I was not a member of the second one. But that has nothing to do with Goldstein.)</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>After hearing about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged">Atlas Shrugged</a> for over a decade, I finally read it, out of a simple and selfish motive. I wanted to get a fresh copy of the book, black out all the political speeches, and auction the marked-up copy through EBay. Surely someone out there would appreciate the joke enough to bid $20 for <cite>Atlas Snipped</cite>&hellip;or at least contribute to my net.reputation by spreading the news of the auction. <p>A few hundred pages later, I realized the flaw in my plan. If I crossed out every political speech (by a hero, villian, or narrator) from the book, I would be left with little more than some out-of-context sex scenes (which, by 2005 standards, are not exactly racy). If I deleted the parts of every political speech <em>that failed to advance the plot</em>, I would probably be able to shrink the book by at least half, but I&rsquo;d have to reread the book with some care in order to figure out exactly where to cut.</p> <p>I don&rsquo;t have enough patience with this book to go through that kind of trouble, but I did notice a certain tension between <cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite>, a book with explicit arguments for certain philosophical ideals, and <cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite>, a story that makes implicit statements of what is right and wrong. Details, with some spoilers, are below the fold.</p> <p>In the world of the novel, every great &ldquo;man of the mind&rdquo; is an Objectivist, or at least holds Objectivist values without being conscious of the philosophical system that unites them. Things are not so neat in the real world. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK-47">The AK-47 assault rifle</a>, for example, is a brilliant work of engineering, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Kalashnikov">its designer</a>, a two-time Hero of Socialist Labor, is not an Objectivist role model in any other respect.</p> <p>The emotional impact of the novel depends on its catastrophic plot, but the plot <em>depends</em> on characters being Objectivist if and only if they are brilliant and courageous. If the world of <cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite> were well-stocked with gifted engineers and managers who were willing to negotiate with the collectivist state, then the strikers of Galt&rsquo;s Gulch would be as politically irrelevant as the Amish. If all the world&rsquo;s &ldquo;men of the mind&rdquo; united behind some other political program, they could shut down the economy in the name of that program, rather than capitalism. (Cf. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Roads_Must_Roll">&ldquo;The Roads Must Roll&rdquo;</a>.)</p> <p>If laissez-faire capitalism is truly superior to every other economic system, then it should be able to demonstrate its superiority <em>even when</em> the competing economic systems are granted their share of talented contributors. <cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite> does not provide such a demonstration. If the strike plot-line is read as an argument, it&rsquo;s an argument for class unity, but not an argument for unity <em>on behalf of</em> anything in particular.</p> <p class="stb">Ayn Rand, speaking as a philosopher through John Galt, presents rationality as the distinguishing mark of the human species, and laissez-faire capitalism as the only economic system that respects human beings as rational actors. But Ayn Rand, portraying the world as a novelist, portrays the vast majority of humanity as anything but rational: they whine for largesse from people wealthier than themselves, they submit to guilt-trips from people poorer than themselves, they don&rsquo;t care to work to improve themselves or their surroundings, and in general they spit on the free market even while enjoying its benefits.</p> <p>By ending her novel <em>just before</em> her heroes leave Galt&rsquo;s Gulch and set out to rebuild the world, Rand avoids laying out the implications of this cynical view of humanity. Many people outside Galt&rsquo;s Gulch would willing to accept laissez-faire capitalism for the short term, as an alternative to starvation, but in the long run, they would look for every opportunity to bring back the bad old days of collectivism. Furthermore, some people&mdash;for example, televangelists&mdash;can amass large fortunes within a capitalist economy <em>without</em> developing any particular loyalty to that economic system, and might contribute some of their fortunes to undermine capitalism.</p> <p>Rand is not interested in showing us how her heroes would grow their wealth while protecting their interests in this post-apocalyptic world. Instead, she invites her readers to imagine the rebuilding process as an uncomplicated triumph, the millenium following the Rapture. Even if her characters could resolve this dilemma in a way consistent with the novel&rsquo;s view of human nature, a sequel that portrayed this resolution would show &ldquo;men of the mind&rdquo; <em>interacting with</em> people who might not share their values, rather than separating from them.</p> <p class="stb">Finally, Rand stumbles against a politically inconvenient fact about capitalism as it is practiced today: Almost every &ldquo;man of the mind,&rdquo; no matter how brilliant and productive, is an <em>employee</em>, not an owner, of the company that takes advantage of his talents. The shareholders of their companies are probably not much smarter or harder-working than the average mortal (compare the average Lucent stockholder with the inventors of Unix), but the shareholders are ultimately in charge.</p> <p>Contrast this banal fact of corporate law with one of the main plot lines of <cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite>: Francisco D&rsquo;Anconia&rsquo;s campaign to destroy D&rsquo;Anconia Copper. <a href="http://forum.objectivismonline.net/index.php?s=56175f1bdaf6fe6834223a15c597846c&showtopic=1924">According to the Objectivist party line</a>, the other shareholders in D&rsquo;Anconia Copper got what they deserved, because any rational shareholder would have sold the stock before the campaign of destruction began. But this excuse rings hollow. If someone hires me to fix his car, and I deliberately destroy it, no character flaw of my employer can justify my sabotage. I was free to refuse the repair job or to fix the car to the best of my ability, but not to accept the job and then ruin the property I was entrusted with. By the same token, D&rsquo;Anconia was free to resign his position and sell his holdings in D&rsquo;Anconia Copper, or to manage the company in good faith. Instead, he violated his fiduciary duty as a corporate manager. <em>This character</em> is a capitalist role model?</p> <p class="stb">The essays within <cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite> use logical argument to advocate a certain philosophy, comprising rationality, empiricism, and individual property rights. The story uses its portrayal of heroes and villains to advocate a much simpler point of view, one not always consistent with the philosophy: <i>People who are like the heroes of this novel deserve everything they have and then some. Everyone else deserves to die.</i> Which, if any, of these moral codes is correct? If you have been inspired by this novel, and are moved to convince everyone else that they should become Objectivists, then perhaps you should check your premises.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>A lot of Democrats have envied the united PR campaigns that Republicans have been able to maintain, with the same talking points faithfully repeated across blogs, talk radio, TV pundit shows, and newspaper columns. Mark Schmitt <a href="http://markschmitt.typepad.com/decembrist/2005/04/what_the_republ.html" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">reminds us</a> that such unity has its price, and the Republicans might be paying the price right now.</p> <blockquote> <p>A command-control system like the White House-led Republican congressional system can be absolutely formidable for a certain period of time. But when it breaks down, it breaks down completely. The collapse is sudden, and total&#8230;.</p> <p>The irony of all this for conservatives is that if they actually read Hayek and got anything out of it other than &#8220;government sucks,&#8221; they would know this. Hayek&#8217;s libertarianism was very pragmatic. Centrally controlled systems are flawed above all because they have no mechanism to correct their own errors, unlike distributed, self-organized systems. The Democrats in the Clinton years always operated in chaos, no one followed the party line, and there was a cost to that, but in the chaos and improvisation they found ways to get out of the holes that they had dug for themselves. The Rove/DeLay/Frist system doesn&#8217;t have any means for correcting its mistakes&#8212;look at the blank, lost looks on the faces of Senators Lugar and Chafee yesterday when they just had no idea what to do with a nomination that had fallen apart and couldn&#8217;t fulfill their promises.</p> </blockquote> <p>Schmitt calls his posting &#8220;What the Republicans Could Learn from Hayek&#8221;. But Democrats could learn something here, too.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>In a posting last year, I remarked that <a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/yo/politics/feminism/gid/what.html">women and men have remarkably different relationships with their same-sex platonic friends, but biographies of transsexuals don&#8217;t reveal much about their platonic friendships</a>. I was intrigued, therefore, to come across a certain passage in <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0060929596">As Nature Made Him</a>, John Colapinto&#8217;s book about Bruce a.k.a. Brenda a.k.a. David Reimer. <p>For those unfamiliar with the case: when Bruce Reimer was eight months old, most of his penis was burned off in a botched circumcision. Following the advice of the famed psychologist John Money, they renamed the child Brenda and tried to raise her as a girl. Brenda had emotional problems throughout her childhood, rebelling against everything associated with girlhood, and when she found out about her medical history as a teenager, she insisted on being reassigned as male.</p> <p>During her childhood as Brenda, one of Reimer&#8217;s few friends was a classmate named Heather Legarry. Colapinto reports:</p> <blockquote>Heather&#8230;valued Brenda as a girl devoid of the <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/theferrett/466248.html">duplicity and backstabbing</a> that had poisoned so many of her relations with girls in the past and that even threatened the harmony of her current clique of tomboys. &#8220;Brenda didn&#8217;t speak much,&#8221; Heather says, &#8220;but when she did she was never vindictive or false. She was very honest. If she told me something was black or white, it was.&#8221; (p.&nbsp;125; link added)</blockquote> <p>As transsexuals go, Reimer is hardly typical, but I&#8217;ll take my data points wherever I can get them.</p> <p class="via">see also <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/lyonesse/227608.html">these comments from lyonesse</a>, who worked in Prof.&nbsp;Money&#8217;s lab, on Reimer</p></p>]]>

Cuba can blame all its problems on the US embargo. North Korea has its nuclear weapons. Engelstan, meanwhile, has the lottery.</p> <p>As part of the celebrations inaugurating each new Five-Year Plan, the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers&#8217; Party of Engelstan draws one worker&#8217;s name from a giant drum.

In order to participate in the lottery, one must have a certificate of good citizenship from the local Workers&#8217; Party office. &#8220;Good citizenship&#8221; has never been precisely defined, but everybody agrees that good citizens speak no ill of the Party, and are quick to denounce anyone who does.</p> <p>Officially, the lottery is supposed to give the people a taste of the life that every comrade will enjoy under communism.

<![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/mangosteen/81925.html">The custom of reserving the parking space that you shoveled out</a> strikes me as an excellent application of <a href="http://www.constitution.org/jl/2ndtr05.htm">John Locke&#8217;s theory of original property acquisition</a>. A parking space on a public street (absent meters and so forth) is common property, but once the owner of a car mixes his or her labor with it, it becomes his or her own (with some reservations), and the driver leaves a token to mark the acquisition. It&#8217;s not kosher to dig out a parking space, mark it, and then leave it empty for days on end, because then you are violating the Lockean principle that when you take from the commons, you should only take what you&#8217;re going to actually use.</p> <p>Of course, according to a strict reading of Locke, all this only applies in the state of nature, and now that we&#8217;re bound by the social contract, we should respect the laws of the civil government, which (at least in Boston) does not recognize any right to keep the parking space that you shoveled out. Then again, if driving in Boston is <em>not</em> the state of nature, it&#8217;s as close to it as I ever want to get.</p> <p>Locke, of course, has had a great influence on English and American political philosophy. In other parts of the world, competing theories of property and government had a stronger influence. So I am wondering: when the snow is a foot deep in France or Sweden or Lithuania, do people also have the custom that you can keep the parking space that you dig out? Are contemporary Americans moved by the dead hand of an eighteenth-century Briton, or was Locke merely using philosophical language to formalize a common human tendency?</p> <p><b>Update:</b> <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/mangosteen/81925.html?thread=629253#t629253%22">In Sweden, the city actually plows the sides of the street so people can park there.</a> What a concept!</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/">Left Business Observer</a> debunked the tales of Social Security &#8220;crisis&#8221; that were circulating back in <a href="http://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/Pensions.html">1994</a> and <a href="http://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/AntisocInsec.html">1998</a>. Now that the Bush administration is pushing Social Security &#8220;reform,&#8221; wonks closer to the Democratic mainstream, such as <a href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&name=ViewWeb&articleId=8976">Matthew Yglesias</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_12/005312.php">Kevin Drum</a>, have come to the same realization.</p> <p>If you don&#8217;t have the patience to read Yglesias or LBO, contemplate <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_12/005316.php">Kevin Drum&#8217;s graph</a>, which shows that &#8220;doomsday&#8221; for the Social Security trust fund has been about 35 years away for the past ten years. If you have a little more patience than that, here&#8217;s my standing-on-one-foot explanation:</p> <ul> <li>The predicted &#8220;bankruptcy&#8221; of the trust fund is simply the time at which, if all the trustees&#8217; predictions come true, the fund will have to borrow money from the general fund instead of loaning money to it.</li> <li>Even if the predictions are accurate, &#8220;bankruptcy&#8221; can be prevented by raising the Social Security tax by a few points (or by making all income, not just wages up to a certain limit, subject to the tax).</li> <li>Even if the predictions are accurate, Social Security taxes are not raised, and Social Security benefits are cut to stave off &#8220;bankruptcy&#8221;, retirees in the 2040s will get more, even after adjusting for inflation, than retirees today.</li> <li>The Social Security trustees have been consistently lowballing their predictions of future economic growth. If US economic growth over the next 40 years is anything like it was for the last 40 years, then there will be no &#8220;bankruptcy.&#8221; If it is as low as the trustees fear, then stocks and bonds aren&#8217;t going to do so well, either.</li> </ul>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Judge Richard Posner (appeals judge on the Seventh Circuit, professor at the University of Chicago) says that <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2004/12/preventive_warp.html">it&#8217;s OK to fight a preventative war if the expected benefits of the war outweigh the expected costs</a>.</p> <p>Quick reality check, ladies and gentlemen: when was the last time two countries went to war and <em>both</em> countries&#8217; leaders had accurately predicted the costs and benefits? Let&#8217;s review the past twenty-five years. The Bush Administration, and every member of Congress who authorized the present invasion of Iraq, underestimated the cost of the occupation. In the previous Gulf War, Saddam Hussein underestimated the likelihood that the US would intervene to protect Kuwait. Slobodan Milosevic underestimated the likelihood that NATO would do anything more than wring its hands over the fate of the Bosnian Muslims. Ariel Sharon underestimated the cost of maintaining a friendly government in Lebanon. Yasser Arafat underestimated the benefit that the Palestinian people would gain from the <i>intifadah</i>.</p> <p>If calculating the costs and benefits of a fight were as easy as pricing a stock option, then few if any countries would go to war at all. &#8220;As you can see from this mathematical proof, our expected benefit from invading you is 500, and our expected cost is only 100.&#8221; &#8220;By Jove, you&#8217;re right! I&#8217;ll just advise my government to unconditionally surrender to you now, and save us both a lot of trouble.&#8221;</p> <p>Indeed, <em>when</em> the costs and benefits of a war are clear to everyone involved, there is no war. In 1940, the military forces of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia were obviously no match for the Red Army. Therefore, when the Soviets sent in troops to occupy those countries, they met with no resistance.</p> <p class="via">via <a href="http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/002956.html">Crooked Timber</a> et al.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Philip Greenspun, responding to an UberNerd friend who believes that &#8220;if you don&#8217;t have a patent you can&#8217;t make any money,&#8221; <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2004/12/15#a7070">observes</a>:</p> <blockquote>Checking <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/03/21/news/fortune500/f500_release/">the top 10 out of the Fortune 500 companies</a>, for example, we find Walmart right on top, followed by Exxon Mobil. Except for IBM none of the companies feels like one based on intellectual property and even IBM these days gets most of its revenue from service. Certainly it is tough to see how an insurance company such as AIG (#10) and a bank such as Citigroup (#8) are living large from patents.</blockquote> <p>I was reminded of a posting from Karsten M.&nbsp;Self on the <a href="http://www.crynwr.com/fsb/">Free Software Business</a> email list almost three years ago. He observed that&#8230;</p> <blockquote> <p>From <a href="http://www.netvalley.com/sales98.html">an industry list of the top 100 computer companies by sales for 1998</a> (latest numbers I&#8217;ve got), there is only <em>one</em> pure-play software company in the top ten, it&#8217;s ranked number ten, and that&#8217;s Microsoft. You have to drop to number 56 to find another (Novell), then 63 (Adobe). The other companies are largely a mix of HW + services (e.g.: IBM) or SW + services (e.g.: Oracle)&#8230;.</p> <p>[Out of the firms in <a href="http://www.softwaremag.com/">Software Magazine</a>&#8217;s &#8220;Software 500&#8221; that list no revenue from services,] the following note software revenues as the bulk of all revenues: Microsoft ($21,591 [million]), SAS ($1,020), Adobe ($1,015), Autodesk ($820), and Symantec ($728). I&#8217;m excluding consulting firms (e.g.: PW-Coopers, Andersen) whose &#8220;software&#8221; revenues are largely associated with consulting services. SAS&#8217;s reported financials exclude service revenues. Only two of these firms (other than Microsoft) could be considered to have a significant desktop presence: Adobe and Autodesk. The delta between them and Microsoft is 20 to one.</p> <p>So, of the top fifty &#8220;software&#8221; firms, there are four which derive the bulk of their revenues from software itself, for a total software revenue contribution of $25.1 billion, 86% of software revenues from <em>software</em> firms comes from Microsoft itself.</p> </blockquote> <p>As far as Internet Time goes, three years is an eon, but I suspect that anyone looking at current figures would see a similar breakdown.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Excerpted from <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_11_14.php#003981">a letter to Joshua Micah Marshall</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>It&#8217;s is a depressing fact that for a candidate to become credible in Democratic politics, they have to hire from among a group of consultants who give them credibility with the fundraisers on K St&#8230; It&#8217;s the same group of consultants who have been running Dem. campaigns since the late 1980&#8217;s. If you look at the partners of the major media firms, for example, you can almost guarantee that they were players for someone in the 1988 campaign.</p> <p>This creates a different problem. For those of my generation of political operatives, the searing election experience was 1994. And the animating ideas, strategy, and tactics of the Republican House majority still dominate the way the Republicans do their politics. Unfortunately, for most of the folks still at the top level of our party, the 1994 election was just one of many elections, and you win some and lose some. For example, it would have been impossible for anybody who lived through 1994 as their baptism into politics to assume that the Swift Boat Veterans attack was anything but harmful and required any reaction but a vicious and immediate counter attack. Yet, that is what the Kerry campaign did&#8230;inexplicable. But clearly a decision made by our &#8220;older&#8221; party hands&#8212;one that I believe proved decisive.</p> </blockquote> <p>I hope that any Democrat who is contemplating a Presidential run in 2008 observes that <em>not only</em> do these guys have a great track record for losing elections, but anointment by &#8220;the fundraisers on K St.&#8221; is hardly the only road to riches any more. The Dean campaign screwed up in a number of ways, but it did conclusively prove that there&#8217;s a way for a candidate to raise heaps of money without going through the traditional party gatekeepers.</p> <p>And if Republican meta-lobbying efforts like <a href="http://www.disinfopedia.org/wiki.phtml?title=K_Street_Project">the K&nbsp;Street Project</a> keep working, those gatekeepers won&#8217;t have much funds to raise, anyway.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>As many of my comrades in Blogovia have observed, <a href="http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/002798.html">the mainstream press&#8217;s obsession with &#8220;balance&#8221;</a> has made it hard for the reality-based community to get its message across. As Brad deLong quipped, if the Republicans say the world is flat and the Democrats say it&#8217;s round, the next day&#8217;s headline will read &#8220;Opinions On Shape Of Earth Differ.&#8221;</p> <p>So how <em>do</em> we get our message across? I regret that I cannot read the mind of the average swing-state voter. I can, however, read a graph.</p> <p><img src="http://ropine.com/img/history_12oct.jpg" align="middle" width="315"></p> <p><a href="http://www.fahrenheit911.com/">Fahrenheit 9/11</a> was the summer movie that mainstream political journalists loved to hate. It was shamelessly partisan; it indulged in cheap shots; it insinuated all sorts of things that could not be proven. It is also the top-grossing documentary in history; it was endorsed by NASCAR champion Dale Ernhardt, Jr.; its release correlates, as you see above, with a 25-point jump in Kerry&#8217;s expected electoral votes. Moore didn&#8217;t beg the networks to give him equal time on the news, or whine about how his side was not fairly represented on the news; he <em>created news</em>.</p> <p>I have my reservations about Moore as a journalist, but as a communications strategy for the left, the documentary looks damn promising.</p> <p>(Note to self: <a href="http://www.thehuntingofthepresident.com/">The Hunting of the President</a> is out on DVD now. Must see.)</p> <p>I would love to see a documentary about Republican vote manipulation in 2004: how Congress established a commission to set voting-machine standards and then didn&#8217;t give it the money to do its job; how Republican front organizations conducted voter-registration drives and threw out Democrats&#8217; registration papers; how easy it is to tamper with electronic voting machines that leave no paper trail; how challenges were used as a deliberate strategy to discourage voting in heavily Democratic districts. Heck, as a bonus, I&#8217;d like to see it mention William Rehnquist&#8217;s participation in the &#8220;Operation Eagle Eye&#8221; voter intimidation project, way back before he was a Justice of the United States Supreme Court.</p> <p>I don&#8217;t want a documentary that tells its audience, &#8220;Republicans stole the 2004 election.&#8221; (I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s true, and even if it is, it&#8217;s hard to make the case without seeming like a sore loser.) I want a documentary that tells its audience, &#8220;Republicans use fraud to prevent Democrats&#8217; votes from being counted.&#8221; I want such a documentary to tell such a compelling and unimpeachable story that the voters who believed Dubya&#8217;s promise to &#8220;bring honor and integrity back to the White House&#8221; will watch it, and think about it, and tell their friends&#8230;and when the Democrats complain of Republican dirty tricks in 2006 and 2008, those voters will think some more about which party stands for &#8220;moral values.&#8221;</p> <p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only person with this idea, either.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p><p>Suppose you&#8217;re a teacher, and you give your class a test, and they don&#8217;t do as well as you had hoped. Of course, you have to mark which answers are right and which answers are wrong. But <em>grading</em> is not <em>teaching</em>. If you take your craft seriously, you have to pay attention to your students, look beyond the raw count of right and wrong answers, and ask: &#8220;How do my students perceive the world? What part of their perception is leading them to answer the questions this way? What can I do to help them think differently?&#8221; It&#8217;s a lot easier to ask these questions if you <em>respect your students</em>, and treat them as people who can also be your teachers.</p> <p>George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and all their apparatchiks have worked very, very hard to earn our disdain, and I don&#8217;t want to deprive them of this property. But if you pour out your resentment on <em>the people who voted for them, as a class,</em> you&#8217;re hurting yourself and your country.</p> <p>We know that <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/printable/?critics/040830crat_atlarge">the vast majority of voters do not use an internally consistent political ideology to decide who to vote for</a>. (That majority is large enough to include Democrats and Republicans, so don&#8217;t gloat.) That means, ladies and gentlemen, that 59,249,702 American adults did <em>not</em> walk into the voting booth and think &#8220;I&#8217;m going to vote for Bush because I want to run our deficit into the stratosphere; give tax cuts to the incredibly wealthy; send our soldiers to die, kill, and torture to prop up a puppet regime in a country whose previous ruler posed no threat to the United States; and seize on every available excuse to gut every part of the Bill of Rights except for the Second Amendment.&#8221; Yes, that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re getting, and some fraction of them probably <em>do</em> want what they&#8217;re getting, but not the whole 59&nbsp;million.</p> <p>Americans were given a multiple-choice test, and 51% of them checked off the wrong box. If we want future elections to go the other way, we need to treat those 59&nbsp;million Americans as our students and teachers, and figure out where we have fallen short of our mission to teach them.</p> <p>Let me <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/27/politics/campaign/27TEXT-OBAMA.html?pagewanted=print&position=">quote</a> from the man who recently became a Senator from Illinois:</p> <blockquote> <p>Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight, there is not a liberal America and a conservative America&#8212;there is the United States of America. There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America and Asian America&#8212;there&#8217;s the United States of America.</p> <p>The pundits, the pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into Red States and Blue States; Red States for Republicans, Blue States for Democrats. But I&#8217;ve got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don&#8217;t like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the Red States. We coach Little League in the Blue States and yes, we&#8217;ve got some gay friends in the Red States. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and there are patriots who supported the war in Iraq.</p> <p>We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.</p> </blockquote></p>]]>

One site, deep in the west end of the city (a heavily African American area), was Shawnee High School. There, a Republican poll worker reportedly challenged a number of voters to provide credentials other than typical identification and forced them to wait in already congested lines for illogical amounts of time while he called the board of elections.</p> <p>As he forced voter Alycia Underwood to stand there waiting, the worker demanded to know her party affiliation. When Underwood refused to answer, he told her she would not be allowed to vote. She said she argued the point with him for several minutes before storming out of the building frustrated and unsure of what had just transpired.</p> <p>Just outside the door she explained to the two Election Protection workers what had taken place, while a group (including me) gathered to listen. The Election Protection monitors called ACLU lawyers, who worked with Underwood to eventually resolve the situation; it ended with her casting a ballot at a neighboring site.</p> <p>According to Tomas Bernal, one of the poll monitors, the poll worker who questioned Underwood had done so to a number of others. The sheriff and board of elections officials were summoned twice to diffuse potentially ugly scenes. Bernal and his colleague report that at least 10 voters were deterred by the worker, most of whom said they simply didn&#8217;t have time to wait around.</p> </blockquote> That entry is datelined <em>Louisville, Kentucky</em>.

<![CDATA[<p>For the past year, cynical Democrats have anticipated that Karl Rove, evil genius that he is, would lock up the election with an &#8220;October surprise&#8221; to push up Bush&#8217;s approval ratings and win the election. The most popular October-suprise theory predicted a conveniently-timed announcement of Osama bin&nbsp;Laden&#8217;s death or capture. Surely, the cynics said, that dastardly Bush Administration has Osama locked up already, waiting to be unveiled at the most dramatic possible moment.</p> <p>And then, on Friday, we had our surprise: a video of a tanned, well-rested, statesmanlike fugitive declaring, <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/79C6AF22-98FB-4A1C-B21F-2BC36E87F61F.htm">&#8220;We&#8217;re at war, and because Allah has granted you an incompetent Commander-in-Chief, I&#8217;m winning. I&#8217;m Osama bin&nbsp;Laden and I approved this message.&#8221;</a> This, after two <em>other</em> surprises that only a wing-nut could spin as good news for the Bush campaign: the flu-vaccine shortage and the vanishing al&nbsp;Qaaqaa explosives.</p> <p>Yet Joshua Micah Marshall, a blogger who used to work for Clinton&#8212;and therefore, I assume, has plenty of connections among other Democratic wonks&#8212;<a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_10_24.php#003851">reported</a> that on the emails he received after the tape was released, &#8220;the opinions ranged the gamut, from panic to indifference&#8230;&#8221; He also bemoaned Democrats&#8217; &#8220;tendency to fret that all is lost, almost to <em>indulge</em> in it, when the car hits a simple bump in the road.&#8221;</p> <p>Panic? Bump in the road?!</p> <p>Is there something in the DC drinking water that makes Democrats afraid of their own shadows? Sheesh!</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>The September 20 issue of the <cite>New Yorker</cite> has an interesting article by Ken Auletta (not available online) about Bob Shrum, one of John Kerry&#8217;s top advisers. One paragraph in the article particularly caught my attention: <blockquote>&#8230;[M]edia advisers in the Kerry camp had a financial incentive to recommend more advertising. They will divide among themselves about eight million dollars of the advertising budget&#8212;with Shrum Devine Donilon getting about five million dollars. By contrast, the Bush campaign&#8217;s [chief media adviser Mark] McKinnon says he is paid a flat salary (which he refuses to disclose), and he asked for advice from a dozen advertising executives around the country who meet weekly to propose and scrutinize ads. The Kerry campaign did not assemble an outside team, and turned down a chance to use <a href="https://www.moveonpac.org/donate/switchad_winners.html">an advertising campaign created by the filmmaker Errol Morris</a>.</blockquote> <p>If my memory is correct, the Dean campaign had a similar deal with Trippi, McMahon &&nbsp;Squier (now <a href="http://www.msastrategies.com/">McMahon, Squier &&nbsp;Associates</a>), the firm in which Dean&#8217;s campaign manager was a partner; TMS got a commission on each ad that the campaign bought. I don&#8217;t think I spent enough time following the Dean blog and forums to really call myself a Deaniac, but from what little I did see, Dean&#8217;s grass-roots supporters were <a href="http://brushstroke.tv/week04_5.html">none too impressed</a> by the advertisements that TMS produced.</p> <p><b>Update:</b> To be fair to Kerry, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6039833/site/newsweek/">Shrum has been effectively demoted</a>; the rising stars in the Kerry campaign are going to help him attack Bush more forcefully, focusing on the mess in Iraq.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s interesting that the commandment &#8220;do not add to the thing that I have commanded you&#8230;&#8221; (Deuteronomy 4:2) comes right before Moses reminds the Israelites of how they sinned at Baal Peor. The <i>midrash halakha</i> explains that one violates this commandment by adding an additional text to one&#8217;s <i>tefillin</i> or adding an additional species to be shaken at Sukkot. But one could also see the behavior at Baal Peor, when some Jews added worship of an idol to their worship of God, to be the ultimate violation of that commandment.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>(For those of you who have been spending too much time engrossed in real life over the past two weeks: a couple of weeks ago, <cite>60 Minutes</cite> released memos that were purportedly written by Lt.&nbsp;Col.&nbsp;Jerry Killian, Dubya&#8217;s commanding officer when he was in the Texas Air National Guard. If they were genuine, the memos would have proven that Bush disobeyed a direct order to attend a flight physical, and they also would have documented that friends of the Bush family were pressuring Killian to give Bush a non-negative performance review. Various members of the <strike>101st</strike>101<sup>st</sup> Keyboard Brigade, not to mention <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/graphics/cbsdocs_091804.html">rival news organizations</a>, suspected that the documents were not genuine, and <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/06/politics/main641481.shtml">CBS is now calling their broadcast a &#8220;mistake.&#8221;</a>) <ul> <li>Memo to my comrades in Blogovia: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&c2coff=1&as_qdr=all&q=killian+site%3Awww.dailykos.com&btnG=Search">don&#8217;t do Dan Rather&#8217;s homework for him</a>! By treating the allegations of forgery as Lies That Must Be Refuted, you just tied your own credibility to CBS&#8217;s, and look where you are now. If the memos <em>had been</em> genuine, CBS had as much information to refute the &#8220;fact-check their asses&#8221; crowd as you did, and a heck of a lot more.</li> <li>No, Virginia, the Killian-memo saga is not further proof of <a href="http://www.chrisnolan.com/archives/000535.html">the awesome power of the blogosphere</a>. Every hack in the Republican party had an incentive to discredit the memos; every competitor to CBS had an incentive to put egg on Dan Rather&#8217;s face. If blogs didn&#8217;t exist, you can be sure that critiques of the memos would have been pushed through the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; media.</li> <li>Given <a href="http://www.emergingdemocraticmajorityweblog.com/donkeyrising/archives/000662.php">the ineffectiveness of the &#8220;Swift Boat Veterans for Truth&#8221; ad campaign</a>, I have trouble believing that all this fuss over the Killian memos will harm Kerry&#8217;s chances of winning the election.</li> </ul></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>(Sorry for falling so far behind in the weekly-drash department&#8230;things have been busy.) <p>The first chapter of Isaiah (the <i>haftorah</i> for <i>Parshat Devarim</i>) is famous for a passage where God seems to be dismimssing the sacrificial service that He instituted:</p> <blockquote>What are your many sacrifices to Me? says God. I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts. I do not delight in the blood of bullocks, lambs, or he goats&#8230;. Stop bringing meaningless offerings; they are offerings of abomination to Me. New Moon, Sabbath, and the Festivals&#8212;I cannot bear iniquity along with solemn assembly. My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts. They are a burden to me; I am weary of hearing them. (Isaiah 1:11&#8211;14, Kaplan translation)</blockquote> <p>How should we understand this paragraph? Place it in the context of an earlier remark:</p> <blockquote>&#8230;The entire head is sick, and the entire heart faint. From head to foot there is nothing sound in it, only wounds, bruises and putrefying sores; they have not been pressed out, or bound up, or softened with oil. (ibid. 5&#8211;6)</blockquote> <p>To what can this be compared? Imagine a doctor recommending a certain course of vitamins to a young man, saying, &#8220;Take these every day to improve your health.&#8221; The man takes the vitamins faithfully, but as he grows older, he starts smoking heavily, his diet goes to hell, he sits around reading blogs when he should be exercising, etc., etc. As the man&#8217;s health deteriorates, the doctor explains that all this bad behavior has consequences, but the patient keeps saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m taking my vitamins!&#8221; and ignores every other piece of advice the doctor ever gave him. After years and years of such fruitless conversations, the doctor rues the day he ever told the patient about those vitamins.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://schemers.org/">Scheme</a>, the Lisp variant that MIT nerds learn in <a href="http://sicp.ai.mit.edu/Spring-2004/">6.001</a>, implementations must be <a href="http://schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-6.html#%_sec_3.5">properly tail-recursive</a>. What does this mean? Suppose you have a the following two Scheme functions (cribbed shamelessly from <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-11.html#call_footnote_Temp_46">the 6.001 textbook</a>: <pre class="listing"> (define (factorial n)   (fact-iter 1 1 n))  (define (fact-iter product counter max-count)   (if (> counter max-count)       product       (fact-iter (* counter product)                  (+ counter 1)                  max-count))) </pre> <p>If you ask for <code>(factorial&amp;nbsp;6)</code>, the factorial function will call <code>(fact-iter&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;6)</code>, which will call <code>(fact-iter&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;6)</code>, and so on up to <code>(fact-iter&amp;nbsp;720&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;6)</code>. In a <em>non-tail-recursive</em> language, <code>(fact-iter&amp;nbsp;720&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;6)</code> will return <code>720</code> to its caller, <code>(fact-iter&amp;nbsp;120&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;6)</code>, which will return the same value to <em>its</em> caller, and all the way back down.</p> <p>A proper Scheme implementation, however, can tell from the structure of the code that all these intermediate function returns are unnecessary, so that <code>(fact-iter&amp;nbsp;720&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;6)</code> can deliver its return value directly to whatever function called <code>(factorial&amp;nbsp;6)</code> in the first place. No matter how large <code>n</code> is, a Scheme interpreter can evaluate <code>(factorial n)</code> <em>without growing the stack</em>. Where programmers in other languages would use <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and other special iterative forms, Scheme programmers just write a recursive procedures like <code>fact-iter</code>.</p> <p>According to Scheme fans, tail recursion is one example of how Scheme doesn&#8217;t force programmers to clutter up their code with useless syntax. According to Scheme foes, tail recursion is one example of how Scheme omits perfectly useful features for the sake of some cult-like ideal of purity. Based on my experiences with a recent Java project, I would like to put in a good word for the fans.</p> <p>I had to write an application that interpreted files in a certain XML format. I chose <a href="http://sax.sourceforge.net">SAX</a> for the job, since it was the fastest free pure-Java XML parser that I knew of. SAX works by setting up a sort of tennis game between two interfaces. The SAX distribution provides an implementation of <a href="http://www.saxproject.org/apidoc/org/xml/sax/XMLReader.html"><code>XMLReader</code></a>, which parses the incoming XML. Every time it sees an &#8220;event&#8221;, such as an opening XML tag, it calls a method on an implementation of <a href="http://www.saxproject.org/apidoc/org/xml/sax/ContentHandler.html">ContentHandler</a>, which you, the programmer using SAX, have to write.</p> <p>My XML application had two notable features. For my first pass through the document, I wanted to look for some information in <em>the opening tag of the root element</em>, and I didn&#8217;t care about processing the rest of the document. The XML format also had a looping construct, so my content handler had to be able to recognize the beginning and end of the loop, and it had to store up all the events in the middle to be replayed.</p> <p>One catch: The interface for <code>ContentHandler</code> doesn&#8217;t give the content handler any way to communicate with the XML reader that&#8217;s sending the events. The only way to tell the reader &#8220;I know you&#8217;re not done with this document, but stop parsing, I don&#8217;t want to see any more&#8221; is to <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/apidocs/org/apache/xml/utils/StopParseException.html">throw an exception</a>. If you want one content handler to hand off its responsibility to another, the rest of the application has to provide the content handler with a reference to the XML reader, so you can call <a href="http://www.saxproject.org/apidoc/org/xml/sax/XMLReader.html#setContentHandler(org.xml.sax.ContentHandler)">the appropriate method</a>. Worst of all, if you&#8217;re trying to collect all of the events within a balanced pair of tags, the content handler has to keep track of how deeply nested the tags are&mdash;even though the XML reader <em>has to</em> keep track of the same information.</p> <p>It would be a nice thing, I thought, if SAX provided another interface, one that let you write a content handler in <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ContinuationPassingStyle">continuation passing style</a>. In this XML processor of my imagination, every CPS-content-handler method would take an extra argument, a proxy for the XML reader itself. When the method finished its work and wanted the parse to continue, it could just call <code>reader.continueParsing(this)</code>. If it wanted to hand off work to another CPS-content-handler, it would call <code>reader.continueParsing(otherHandler)</code>. If it needed information about how deeply nested the current element was, it could call <code>reader.getDepth()</code>; other methods could provide other useful information about the context of the event being processed, such as the names of enclosing tags. And if a CPS-content-handler method wanted to stop parsing, it would simply exit without calling <code>reader.continueParsing()</code>.</p> <p>(The Java servlet filter API uses this strategy. If a <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/api/javax/servlet/Filter.html#doFilter(javax.servlet.ServletRequest,%20javax.servlet.ServletResponse,%20javax.servlet.FilterChain)">filter</a> wants to pass control to the next filter in the filter chain, it calls <code>chain.doFilter()</code>; if it wants to block further request processing, it doesn&#8217;t call that method.)</p> <p>But alas! Even though <a href="http://java.sun.com/features/2003/05/steele_qa.html">one of the architects of Scheme</a> has spent the last ten years working for Sun, Java is not guaranteed to be properly tail-recursive. Therefore, all these calls from the XML reader to the CPS-content-handler and back would add two stack frames for every parsing event, until the whole parse was completed&mdash;or, more likely, until the stack overflowed and a fatal exception stopped the whole application.</p> <p>Perhaps I can convince the Powers that Be at <a href="http://jenzabar.net/">my employer</a> to write their next multi-million-dollar <abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</abbr> application in Scheme, instead of Java. I&#8217;m not exactly holding my breath.</p></p>]]>

But as a Democrat, I am overjoyed that the party gave bloggers this unprecedented visibility. Whoever suggested inviting bloggers to the DNC deserves a high-ranking position in the Kerry Administration&#8217;s media-relations office. <p>Think of all the blog-related coverage last week in the <em>mainstream</em> media: stories about the DNC&#8217;s decision to give credentials to bloggers, stories about blogs in general, human-interest pieces about individual big-name bloggers, hand-wringing about the bloggers versus professional journalists, etc., etc. Every column-inch of those newspaper stories, and every second of that broadcast time, was a column-inch and a second <em>not</em> spent covering the Republicans&#8217; response to all the Democrats&#8217; campaign speeches.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>The Shabbat following Tisha b&#8217;Av, &#8220;Shabbat Nachamu,&#8221; is a popular day for holding that peculiar Orthodox Jewish institution, the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&q=singles+shabbaton&btnG=Search">singles shabbaton</a>. Leaders of the Orthodox community are very concerned that single Jews get married. One way they demonstrate this concern is by organizing these events for singles. Another way is by wringing their hands over the Orthodox community&#8217;s declining marriage rate, often using the word <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=orthodox+singles+crisis&sourceid=firefox&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">&#8220;crisis&#8221;</a>. <p>Pundits within our community have a ready explanation for this crisis: the singles are <em>too picky</em>. But this explains nothing. If there were only one single Jewish woman in the world, and every single Jewish man was at least twenty years older than her and covered with suppurating boils, the woman&#8217;s mother could accuse her of being &#8220;too picky&#8221; for not marrying one of them. Can we explain the declining Orthodox marriage rate without appealing to a tautology?</p> <p>We live in a society where The Market reigns supreme. The habits and values associated with capitalism infect the other kinds of relationships we have. (I hear <a href="http://marxists.org/">some dead Jewish guy</a> had more to say on this topic.) Thus, for example, <a href="http://www.nyblueprint.com/article.asp?aid=47">a conference last year for single Jews</a> included a workshop called &#8220;Headhunting in the Marriage Market: A systematic and efficient method to package yourself, find, and evaluate a potential spouse.&#8221; If you treat yourself and your prospective spouse as products to be packaged, marketed, and evaluated, <em>and</em> hope that whoever you choose will stay married to you for life, you&#8217;re setting yourself up for paralysis. Anyone who&#8217;s made an offer on a house knows the fear that this incredibly expensive thing they&#8217;re buying might have some expensive flaw that they won&#8217;t notice until three months after the closing. In a culture that considers divorce a tragedy at best and a moral failing at worst, the corresponding fear about a spouse can be even more intimidating.</p> <p>When you get married, you are not just making a business deal; you are committing to <em>become a different person</em>. With the help of your spouse, you are empowered to do a wide range of things that were beyond you as a single man or woman. At the same time, your responsibilities to your spouse prevent you from taking a wide range of actions that were previously open to you. The exact configuration of new powers and new restrictions depends on the personality and abilities of whoever you marry, the way you both decide to run your marriage, and the feedback effects that result from your mutual influence.</p> <p>Treating your search for a mate as a &#8220;market&#8221; in which you have to &#8220;package yourself&#8221; is not compatible with this view of marriage. If you know that your marriage is going to make you a different person, you need to have some idea about what kind of person you want to become. (&#8220;The same kind of person I am now, but with more frequent sex&#8221; doesn&#8217;t count. Sorry.) Worse, at some point in a dating relationship, you need to <em>reveal</em> what kind of person you want to become, and see how much the other person can help you reach that goal. That&#8217;s not the way we play things in The Market. When you put a house up for sale, if you know the discipline of The Market, you don&#8217;t reveal how anxious you are to get the building off your hands before you start a new job in a city five hundred miles away.</p> <p>If we as a Jewish community want more people to find spouses, we need to do a better job at helping them find themselves, and not just giving them <a href="http://www.endthemadness.org/challenge/etm1.html">brand names</a> to identify with.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>When the leaders of Reuven and Gad approached Moses with their audacious plan to <em>not</em> cross the Jordan River, Moses accused them: &#8220;This is what your parents did, when I sent them to Kadesh Barnea to scout the land: They went to the wadi of Eshkol, scouted the land, and demoralized the Israelites, until they were unwilling to go to the land that the Eternal had given them&#8221; (Numbers 32:9&#8211;10). This accusation is not entirely fair. Reuven and Gad weren&#8217;t imitating their parents; they were imitating their <em>peers</em>. <p>After the scouts&#8217; report, the Israelites were not only refusing to enter the land: they were saying to one another, &#8220;Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt&#8221; (14:4). Reuven and Gad, by contrast, did not feel any nostalgia for Egypt. They were just so content with their <em>present</em> situation that they didn&#8217;t even want to try out Israel&#8217;s pasture land before rejecting it.</p> <p>It might be more accurate to compare Reuven and Gad with the officers in the war against Midian, who killed all the Midianite men but kept the women and children alive (30:9). As Moses reminded them later, these were the same women who had tempted so many of their comrades into idolatry (31:16). Were the Israelite officers keeping the women alive so that they could be sent off to live with their cousins in Syria? More likely, the soldiers just saw a chance to get the same thing they had gotten before the war, only this time without the idol worship.</p> <p>In this parsha, even before the Jewish nation crossed the border into Canaan, they crossed a different kind of border: from the temptations of the slave to the temptations of a wealthy householder.

<![CDATA[<p>Suppose you&#8217;re writing a Java application that reads information from an <span class="caps">XML</span> file, using <a href="http://sax.sourceforge.net"><span class="caps">SAX</span></a> to parse it, and you want to dispatch to different methods in your Java code based on the names of elements the parser is encountering. That is, you have one method that you want to execute when the parser reads a <code>&amp;lt;bird&amp;gt;</code> tag, another one for when the parser reads a <code>&amp;lt;dog&amp;gt;</code> tag, and so forth. <p>The obvious way to do this is to write an implementation of <a href="http://www.saxproject.org/apidoc/org/xml/sax/ContentHandler.html">ContentHandler</a> that explicitly tests the tag name and calls the right procedure, like so:</p> <pre class="listing"> public class MundaneDispatcher implements ContentHandler {
    public void startElement
     (String uri, String localName, String qName, Attributes atts)
     throws <span class="caps">SAXE</span>xception {
       if (localName.equals(&#8220;bird&#8221;)) {
         System.out.println(&#8220;Open beak&#8221;);
       } else if (localName.equals(&#8220;dog&#8221;)) {
         System.out.println(&#8220;Open jaws&#8221;);
       } else if (localName.equals(&#8220;flower&#8221;)) {
         System.out.println(&#8220;Open petals&#8221;);
       } else if (localName.equals(&#8220;ventureCapitalist&#8221;)) {
         System.out.println(&#8220;Open wallet&#8221;);
       } else {
         System.err.println(&#8220;No handler for &#8220; + localName);
       }      // &#8230; other methods &#8230; } </pre> <p>We can also solve this problem using Java&#8217;s reflection <span class="caps">API</span>. You can define a class that <em>looks at its own list of methods</em> to find out which ones can process an <span class="caps">XML</span> tag, and whose <code>startElement</code> method uses the results of that introspection to handle the dispatching. Like so:</p> <pre class="listing" style="height: 300px; overflow: scroll;"> public abstract class AbstractElegantDispatcher implements ContentHandler {
   private Map startElementHandlers;
    protected AbstractElegantDispatcher() {
       startElementHandlers = new HashMap();
       Method[] methods = getClass().getMethods();
       for (int i = 0; i &lt; methods.length; i++) {
         Method oneMethod = methods[i];
         if (oneMethod.getReturnType().equals(Void.TYPE)) {
           Class[] arguments = oneMethod.getParameterTypes();
           if (arguments.length == 1
               &amp;&amp; arguments<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn168683983147c842e0abb89">0</a></sup>.isAssignableFrom(Attributes.class)) {
             startElementHandlers.put(oneMethod.getName(), oneMethod);
           }
         }
       }
   }
      public void startElement
     (String uri, String localName, String qName, Attributes atts)
     throws <span class="caps">SAXE</span>xception {
       Method thisElementHandler =
         (Method) startElementHandlers.get(localName);
       if (thisElementHandler != null) {
         invokeElementHandler(thisElementHandler, atts);
       } else {
         System.err.println(&#8220;No handler for &#8220; + localName);
       }
   }
      // &#8230; other methods &#8230;
      private void invokeElementHandler
     (Method handler, Attributes atts)
     throws <span class="caps">SAXE</span>xception {
       try {
         handler.invoke(this, new Object[] { atts });
       } catch (IllegalAccessException e) {
         System.err.println(&#8220;Access violation!&#8221;);
       } catch (InvocationTargetException e) {
         Throwable t = e.getCause();
         if (t instanceof RuntimeException) {
           throw (RuntimeException) t;
         } else if (t instanceof <span class="caps">SAXE</span>xception) {
           throw (<span class="caps">SAXE</span>xception) t;
         } else if (t instanceof Exception) {
           throw new <span class="caps">SAXE</span>xception((Exception) t);
         } else {
           throw new RuntimeException(t);
         }
       }
   }
 } </pre> <p>With that framework in place, you can define a class like this:</p> <pre class="listing"> public class AnimalHandler extends AbstractElegantDispatcher {
    public void bird(Attributes atts) {
     System.out.println(&#8220;Open beak&#8221;);
   }
      public void dog(Attributes atts) {
     System.out.println(&#8220;Open jaws&#8221;);
   }
      public void flower(Attributes atts) {
     System.out.println(&#8220;Open petals&#8221;);
   }
      public void ventureCapitalist(Attributes atts) {
     System.out.println(&#8220;Open wallet&#8221;);
   }
 } </pre><p> That&#8217;s a hell of a lot of extra code. What do you get for it? <p>In MundaneDispatcher, the mapping between <span class="caps">XML</span> tags and method calls, a very significant aspect of your code&#8217;s organization, is buried in the chain of <code>if ... else if ...</code> blocks. Yes, you can follow a naming convention saying that <code>&amp;lt;bird&amp;gt;</code> tags always invoke <code>birdHandler()</code> methods, etc., but what if someone makes a typo and writes <code>birdHadnler()</code> instead?</p> <p>In AnimalHandler, the mapping couldn&#8217;t be clearer: every method that takes a single <code>Attributes</code> argument corresponds to an <span class="caps">XML</span> opening tag with the same name. If another programmer takes responsibility for the AnimalHandler class, they can make it support more tags by adding more methods. If someone else wants to write another class that processes a different <span class="caps">XML</span>-based language in a similar way, they can just make another subclass of AbstractElementDispatcher.</p> <p>In general, whenever I&#8217;m trying to code something, and I find myself bored by the prospect of typing the same damn thing over and over and over again, I look for some kind of higher-level mechanism&#8212;in this case, the Java reflection <span class="caps">API</span>&#8212;to spare myself the tedium. If computers can save accountants the chore of adding up long columns of numbers, and save writers the chore of retyping a heavily edited document from beginning to end, why can&#8217;t they save <em>computer programmers</em> some of the chores associated with our job?</p> <p>(For a self-contained class that demonstrates both of these methods, see <a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/java/TagMapDemo.java.txt">here</a>. Since this is all based on stuff I did at work, <a href="http://jenzabar.net/">my employer</a> owns the copyright, but my boss has given me permission to publish the demo code under a <span class="caps">BSD</span> license. Share and enjoy!)</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Before the story of Tzelophchad&#8217;s daughters is even told, their names are listed, in Numbers 26:33. The list appears again, in 27:1, before they ask their question to Moses about their inheritance, and a third time, in 36:11, in conjunction with the law requiring them to marry within their tribe. The laws related to their situation would have been just as clear without listing their names; why bother repeating them? <p>Even today, if parents have a run of three or more children of the same sex, they can expect some muttering and speculation, and possibly even rude questions, about whether or not they are disappointed, or &#8220;trying for&#8221; a child of the other sex, or some such. In a society as patriarchal as the ancient Middle East, one can imagine how much more gossip would surround a father with a prestigious ancestry who had five daughters and no sons.</p> <p>Perhaps Tzelophchad and his wife were trying to quench that gossip when they named their youngest daughter Tirtzah&#8212;from the root <i>r-tz-h</i>, &#8220;to be pleased with, to accept.&#8221; (See, for example, Genesis 33:10, Exodus 28:38, Leviticus 26:41.) Tirtzah and her sisters could observe that if the youngest child of the family was given this name, then <i>kal va-chomer</i> the four elder daughters were valued for who they were, and their parents had no regrets that God had only sent them daughters. With that self-confidence, they were able to present their case to Moses.</p> <p>The lesson for contemporary parents is left as an exercise for the reader.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s not easy being beautiful. Even if you were blessed with the right parents (sparing you the expense of the right plastic surgeon), preserving one&#8217;s looks takes the constant effort of diet and exercise, and maximizing their effect requires careful investment in clothes, hair products, and cosmetics. And after all that, if you show your dazzling face in public, everybody who sees it enjoys the fruit of your labor, but nobody has to compensate you for it. Nobody, that is, except for the citizens of Khazaristan. <p>In that country, wherever twenty or more people might gather (busy intersections, parks, restaurants, stadiums, and so on) there is a hidden camera, programmed to go off at random times of the day and night. The tireless belletometrists at the Department of Aesthetic Compensation study these crowd scenes, scoring the face, dress, and comportment of everyone in them. The citizens who were photographed can go to the Department, and if they can be identified in the picture, they can claim a royalty, proportional to their score and the number of other people present. Similar programs reward the owners of attractive cars, houses, and speaking voices.</p> <p>Since these rewards are paid out of general tax revenues, the plain citizens are effectively subsidizing the good-looking ones. The most beautiful of them all can live off the royalties from the Department, a practice that gives new meaning to the phrase &#8220;walk the streets for money&#8221;.</p> <p>Ever since instituting this policy, Khazaristan&#8217;s tourism industry has boomed. In addition, its clinic for plastic surgery is the most highly regarded in the world. The clinic has two departments. One corrects the accidents of nature with face-lifts, nose jobs, liposuctions, and so forth. The other specializes in reconstructive surgery for acid burns, to help victims of the country&#8217;s most common violent crime.</p> <p>At the most recent meeting of the World Trade Organization, the Secretary of Aesthetic Compensation of Khazaristan, a former Miss Universe, attended a panel on cross-border intellectual property rights. After the US representative spoke about the social benefits of patent and copyright protection, and the need for all countries to cooperate on enforcing these rights, the Secretary rose to her feet. She spoke of the public benefit that beautiful people can perform for an ugly world, and challenged the other countries to follow Khazaristan&#8217;s example, and to ensure that alongside the catchy tune and the innovative drug, the handsome face get its due reward. When the US representative laughed, the Secretary excused herself from the meeting. <cite>Time</cite> and <cite>Newsweek</cite> ran photographs of the Secretary&#8217;s pouting face on their covers.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Imagine if, back when desegregation was the controversy of the day, someone had proposed: &#8220;Let&#8217;s compromise. Let&#8217;s let the black kids into our schools, with all the duties and privileges of the white students, and give them diplomas that give them exactly the same legal recognition as the white graduates&#8217; diplomas&nbsp;&#8230; but <em>don&#8217;t call them &#8216;students.&#8217;</em> Call them, umm, &#8216;civil learners.&#8217;&#8221; Nobody, on either side of the integration wars, would have taken this idea seriously. But when the controversy of the day is gay marriage, <a href="http://pollingreport.com/civil.htm">one out of every four Americans</a> opposes gay marriage <em>and</em> supports gay civil unions. And <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/02/24/elec04.prez.bush.marriage/">President Bush</a>, <a href="http://www.johnkerry.com/issues/glbt/">Senator Kerry</a>, and <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2004/03/29/text_of_gay_marriage_ban_amendment_proposed_by_joint_leadership_1080581819/">the Massachusetts state legislature</a> all take these folks seriously. What&#8217;s going on here? <p>One of the most common arguments against same-sex marriage seems to be the claim that letting same-sex couples marry will &#8220;dilute&#8221; the institution of marriage. The claim is <a href="http://www.felbers.net/mt/archives/2003_07.html">easy to mock</a>, and as far as I&#8217;m concerned makes no rational sense, but if tens of millions of Americans would grant gay couples all the legal benefits of marriage <em>except for the name</em>, perhaps we should try to understand why this name has such power. I would suggest that <a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/yo/politics/feminism/gid/what.html">gender identity</a> is the culprit here.</p> <p>As I discussed earlier, a person&#8217;s gender identity is his or her desire to be recognized as a man or as a woman. So, for example, Diane Wilson begins <a href="http://www.firelily.com/gender/resources/empathy.html">an essay</a> by saying &#8220;Imagine that you are the person you are right now, but only on the inside. On the outside, you have the body of a person of a different gender.&#8221; We can translate that as &#8220;Imagine that you <em>wish</em>, on the inside, that people treat you as the person you are now. But on the outside, you have the body of a person of a different gender, and everybody treats you as such.&#8221;</p> <p>(Colt Illicit <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/coltillicit/10186.html?thread=38346#t38346">argues</a>, based on his own experience and observations, that &#8220;sex identity,&#8221; the desire to have a certain set of genitals, is psychologically distinct from gender identity. I&#8217;ll accept the argument, but it seems to me that even for sex identity, there&#8217;s some psycho-social component. I&#8217;ve never heard of anyone having a burning desire to remove an uninfected set of tonsils, or otherwise change a healthy body part <em>that nobody else will ever see</em>.)</p> <p>Now, if you care about other people treating you as a member of a certain gender, you have to do something to respect <em>their</em> desires. (If I went around telling my friends and co-workers, &#8220;I&#8217;d like you to think of me as a woman,&#8221; and did nothing to change my appearance or behavior, I wouldn&#8217;t get much cooperation. At the very least, I would get better results if I shaved.) So people learn, <a href="http://www.colby.edu/personal/j/jfboylan/snt_excerpt.htm">from a very early age</a>, what signals men and women use to announce their respective genders.</p> <p>And a number of these signals are tied up with heterosexual marriage. If a person says &#8220;I am this woman&#8217;s husband,&#8221; or even &#8220;I&#8217;m looking for a wife,&#8221; that person is sending out an &#8220;I am male&#8221; signal. Those people who care about their gender identities, and who are used to relying on marriage-related signals to communicate their genders, are not going to appreciate this kind of noise in their communications channel, so to speak.</p> <p>Of course, even if all of these marriage-related signals became unreliable, people could still use other signals to communicate their genders. So what? If half of all stop signs were suddenly painted blue, people would still recognize their message from the signs&#8217; shape and wording&#8230;but most drivers would not be happy about the change.</p> <p>(One could argue that the people who are made uncomfortable by gay marriage will just have to deal with it, and it&#8217;s better to make them uncomfortable than to settle for civil unions. Since civil unions really <em>would</em> carry the same rights and privileges as heterosexual marriage&#8212;unlike Jim Crow segregated institutions, where separate facilities were almost never equal&#8212;I&#8217;m not sure whether or not I agree with this argument.)</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>[A few years ago, on my old static Web site, I started a series of essays describing political systems of imaginary countries. I&#8217;m revising those old essays and posting them here, and God willing, I&#8217;ll continue the series in the weeks and months to come.] <hr> <p>In the <cite>United Nations Statistical Handbook</cite>, the entry for Vespucci Island has no entry for &#8220;population.&#8221; Nor does it say anything about the country&#8217;s Gross Domestic Product, its fertility rate, its literacy rate, or a dozen other statistics. The Vespuccian government, bound by a constitution with the world&#8217;s strictest privacy clauses, maintains no such information about its population, and Vespuccian citizens are proud of their government&#8217;s ignorance.</p> <p>All Vespuccians have the right to keep their biometric information (their photographs, fingerprints, retina prints, etc.) strictly apart from their financial information (their assets, debts, account numbers, etc.). Since these two kinds of data are most easily linked through a person&#8217;s name, this translates to a right to be anonymous. A Vespuccian driver&#8217;s license has a photograph of its owner, an inscription certifying &#8220;this person is licensed to drive any automobile under such-and-such a weight&#8221;, and all the other usual accoutrements of driver&#8217;s licenses&#8212;but no name. A Vespuccian can open a bank account anywhere in the country without providing any kind of identification, using any name that he or she wishes. Vespuccian passports do have names beside their photographs, but only because other countries refused to accept anonymous travel documents. If an 20-year-old man asks for a passport made out to &#8220;Marilyn Monroe, born January 1, 1700,&#8221; the Minister of Foreign Relations will happily issue him one.</p> <p>Even when ignorant of its citizens&#8217; lives, the Vespuccian government manages to collect money from them. Its chief sources of revenue are the court tax, the weight tax, and the heat tax. Whenever people sign a contract or convey property to one another, and they want their agreement to be enforceable in court, they need to pay a tax in proportion to the maximum that any party could win from a lawsuit. Factories, warehouses, and retail stores have to record the weight of all goods they bring in for processing or sale, and pay an excise tax on the weight. The heat tax is based on the temperature of the waste water coming out of a building, and on satellite images showing the temperature of the surrounding air; it is charged to the property&#8217;s owner of record.</p> <p>Both a progressive income tax and a traditional welfare system are impossible on Vespucci Island. There is no way to tell, by inspecting a bank&#8217;s records, the difference between five poor depositors and one rich depsitor using five aliases. However, the government does pay a monthly stipend, sufficient for food and shelter, to every citizen who wants one. On the first day of the month, you can show up at your local Welfare Office and have your picture taken. If the picture does not match any file photographs of foreign visitors, or of people who have visited a Welfare Office earlier on the same day, then you can receive your stipend as cash, or as a check made out to the name of your choice. At the end of the day, the file of photographs used to prevent double-dipping is erased.</p> <p>As various money-laundering interests sought alternatives to Switzerland and the Caymans, some alighted on Vespucci Island, and the attention of larger countries&#8217; governments followed them. After acrimonious debate, the legislature made an exception to its privacy laws: Anyone who brings foreign currency into or out of Vespuccian territory must have his or her picture posted, along with the amount being transferred, on the government&#8217;s Web site. This was enough to make the gangsters lose interest.</p></p>]]>

Balkinization gives a good <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2004/07/postponing-election.html">rundown of the relevant laws</a>. <p>The MSNBC article linked to above says: &#8220;Some legal scholars told NBC News that if a big enough Madrid-type attack were to disrupt voting in just one state, the entire election would have to be suspended because of the constitutional requirement that the election take place on the same day across the country.&#8221; <a href="http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Constitution.html">This is not quite what the Constitution says.</a> Article II, Section 1: &#8220;The Congress <em>may</em> [emphasis added] determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.&#8221; According to Federal law (<a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/3/2.html">3&nbsp;USC&nbsp;2</a>), &#8220;Whenever any State has held an election for the purpose of choosing electors, and has failed to make a choice on the day prescribed by law, the electors may be appointed on a subsequent day in such a manner as the legislature of such State may direct.&#8221; So if, say, there&#8217;s another massive terrorist attack in New York on Election Day, there&#8217;s nothing to prevent the New York state legislature from passing a law scheduling a make-up election to chose New York&#8217;s electors for President. As long as the make-up election happens before the Electoral College is scheduled to meet, there&#8217;s no need for the Federal government to do anything.</p> <p>Between 9/11/01 and, say, last fall, I could imagine Bush pushing through a law that would give some executive-branch agency the power to postpone elections in case of terrorist attack. I have a much harder time imagining Bush passing such a law in the current political climate. And without an amendment to the law, the Department of Homeland Security doesn&#8217;t have the authority to do diddly-squat about the election schedule. Considering <a href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-6696.ZS.html"><i>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</i></a>, especially <a href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-6696.ZD.html">Justice Scalia&#8217;s scathing dissent</a>, if the DHS does try to take action on postponing an election without permission from Congress, I have a hard time imagining the Supremes letting them get away with it.</p> <p>Having said all that, I can imagine a few ways for Dubya to get leverage out of an Election Day terrorist attack.</p> <p>First, if Tom Ridge hits the airwaves <em>talking about</em> an election postponement, even if he has no authority to do anything, it might confuse or scare a lot of voters into staying home. If more Democrats stay home than Republicans, there&#8217;s plenty of time afterwards for the courts to confirm that a valid election was held on the appointed day, and the Democrats who stayed home will have four more years to regret their decision.</p> <p>Second, if terrorists hit <em>a swing state</em> that&#8217;s likely to vote Democratic but has a majority-Republican legislature, voiding the election in that state&#8230;3&nbsp;USC&nbsp;2 doesn&#8217;t require the state legislature to schedule <em>another election</em> to choose the state&#8217;s electors. They can just appoint the electors directly.</p> <p>I don&#8217;t think even the current crop of Republicans would <em>cause</em> (or fake) a terrorist attack on Election Day in order to set these plans in motion, but if bin&nbsp;Laden gives them one, you can depend on them taking advantage of it. Just <a href="http://democrats.com/view.cfm?id=6543">remember what they did in Florida</a>.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Once upon a time in 1998, Sun Microsystems released &#8220;Java 1.0&#8221; onto an unsuspecting world. As is the case with most &#8220;1.0&#8221; products that neither embarass nor bankrupt their sponsors, this was followed by &#8220;Java 1.1&#8221;. When it was time for the next version to be released, there must have been some kind of tug of war between the development and marketing wings of the company: as far as hackers were concerned, it was &#8220;Java 1.2,&#8221; but as far as the marketing department was concerned, it was &#8220;Java 2&#8221;. At some point&#8212;I don&#8217;t know whether this was at the 1.2 or 1.3 release&#8212;the Java platform split into &#8220;Java 2 Standard Edition,&#8221; &#8220;Java 2 Micro Edition,&#8221; and &#8220;Java 2 Enterprise Edition.&#8221; But at any rate, when the version numbers were bumped again, you didn&#8217;t have &#8220;Java 2 Standard Edition&#8221; become &#8220;Java 3 Standard Edition&#8221;; instead, it was &#8220;Java 2 Standard Edition 1.3.&#8221; Likewise for 1.4. <p>And now, Sun is almost ready to foist a new version of Java on us, and what do they call it? <a href="http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2004-06/sunflash.20040628.3.html">&#8220;Java 2 Platform Standard Edition (J2SE) 5.0.&#8221;</a></p> <p>I hear that Sun is in difficult financial straits these days.

<![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s say that you are an independent consultant, hawking your services as a computer programmer. The people who hire you don&#8217;t understand anything about computers; the only way they know you&#8217;re qualified to work for them is that you have a reputation for using computers to solve lots of other people&#8217;s problems. <p>So one day, a very rich and powerful man approaches you and says he wants to hire you. You hear him describe what he wants you to do, and after thinking over the problem for a while, you decide that you can&#8217;t do it; indeed, you&#8217;re not sure <em>anyone</em> can. But the man insists, and it&#8217;s clear that if you even <em>try</em> to fulfill his assignment, he&#8217;ll pay you very, very, very well.</p> <p>If you&#8217;re an ethical consultant, and you still want to try for this man&#8217;s business, you say, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do the thing that you&#8217;re asking, but tell me more. <em>Why</em> do you want me to write this program? What problem are you trying to solve? If you&#8217;ll let me deviate from the specific assignment that you&#8217;re giving me here, I might find another way to solve that problem.&#8221;</p> <p>If you&#8217;re an unethical consultant, you&#8217;ll just take the job and the money, continuing your patter about how you may not be able to do the work, making sure that your payment doesn&#8217;t depend on success. Who knows, maybe you&#8217;ll luck out and find a way to do the job. If not, you have excuses for failure at the ready.</p> <p>What does all of this have to do with the story of Balaam? Replace &#8220;computers&#8221; with &#8220;sorcery&#8221; in the above paragraph.</p> <p>From the Moabites&#8217; statements in Numbers 22:2&#8211;4, it&#8217;s clear that Balak and his ministers (unlike, say, the Amalekites) saw themselves as acting defensively; he wanted Balaam to curse the Israelites <em>as a means to an end</em>. Furthermore, since Moab and Midian were not part of Canaan, Balak <em>could have</em> easily reached an accommodation with the Israelites that would have spared both sides from war. Balaam, with his pipeline to God, was in a position to know this. If Balak was simply concerned that Moab would suffer the fate of the Amorites, Balaam could have blessed Moab that as long as they let the Israelites pass safely, they would not be attacked. If Balak was concerned that the herds passing through would ruin Moabite pasture land (this is the opinion of the Akeidat Yitzchak, cited <a href="http://www.ou.org/torah/ti/5764/balak64.htm">here</a>), Balaam could have blessed the pastures.</p> <p>But if he had investigated any of these alternatives, Balaam would have had to explicitly turn down a lucrative and ego-inflating assignment&#8212;cursing a nation that had achieved one outstanding military victory after another&#8212;and convince his client to pay him for a more modest task. An ethical sorcerer would have done just that, but Balaam was not such a man.</p> <p>PS: After he failed to curse the Israelites, Balaam came up with the idea of using Moabite women to seduce them (25:1&#8211;9, 31:16). My wife points out that he could have proposed this to Balak from the start. Of course, if he had told Balak up front that something <em>other than</em> sorcery was Balak&#8217;s best hope for victory, it wouldn&#8217;t have done much for Balaam&#8217;s reputation as a professional sorcerer.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>In the passage describing the laws of the red heifer, the procedure for burning the heifer and accumulating the ashes is referred to as a <i>chatat</i>, a sin-offering (Numbers 19:9); when describing how these ashes must be used on someone who has come in contact with a corpse, the related verb <i>yitchata</i> is used (19:12). Why? If, say, someone has a heart attack and dies in a house that you are visiting, the death isn&#8217;t <em>your</em> fault; where&#8217;s the sin? <p>For one answer to this, we can look at commentary on the sacrifices that a woman brings after giving birth. There, she is required to bring a dove as a <i>chatat</i> (Leviticus 12:6, 8). Again, we could ask, what&#8217;s the sin in having a baby? Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai explains: while she was in labor, the woman might have sworn never to have relations with her husband again (Niddah 31b), forgotten the oath, and then violated it.</p> <p>In a similar vein, the experience of being near a dead body, while not a sin in itself, puts someone at a much greater risk for it. Consider what happens in this parsha. Right after the laws of the red heifer are passed down, Miriam dies (Numbers 20:1). While the Torah records many deaths, this is the first one since the Exodus where a dead person is named and the death is <em>not</em> attributed to his or her misdeeds. Then, when the people grumble about not having water, the usual roles of Moses and God are reversed. Instead of God speaking of a harsh punishment and Moses begging for mercy, God simply tells Moses how to provide the people with water and Moses loses his temper at them (20:2&#8211;13). Because Moses could not stay focused on his duty in the aftermath of his sister&#8217;s death, he was denied admission into the Land of Israel.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Michelle Cottle <a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=life&s=cottle061804">observes</a> that while liberals flame on and on about &#8220;hypocritical&#8221; acts by conservatives (Henry Hyde&#8217;s &#8220;youthful indiscretions,&#8221; Rush Limbaugh&#8217;s drug addition, William Bennett&#8217;s gambling habit, Jack Ryan&#8217;s taste for kinky sex clubs, and now Dick Cheney&#8217;s naughty language), conservatives themselves don&#8217;t seem particularly bothered by it. <p>I&#8217;ll agree that this focus on hypocrisy is a bad rhetorical strategy for liberals, but there is one area where conservatives perceive, and mercilessly lampoon, liberal hypocrisy: wealth. If you read all the snark about how rich Kerry and his wife are, or if you recall the outrage over Hillary Clinton making a killing in the commodities market, you&#8217;d think that it&#8217;s some kind of disgrace for a liberal to have large quantities of money. (I <em>assume</em> they consider this wealth to be some kind of hypocrisy, rather than a bad thing in and of itself; our Vice-President didn&#8217;t exactly spend the last twenty years as a Franciscan monk, and his fellow Republicans don&#8217;t hold his career against him.)</p> <p>But where&#8217;s the hypocrisy? Mere <em>possession</em> of wealth has never been a sin among liberals. Lefties have offered a number of justifications for raising the income taxes paid by the rich, but as far as I know, &#8220;let&#8217;s punish these guys for having so much money&#8221; has never been one of them. Heck, having money isn&#8217;t even a sin among Marxists&#8212;the literate ones, at least. <a href="http://www.imjustsayin.net/silverlake/kbknostalgia-textdocument.html">Karl and Fred</a> did not see the struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie as a battle of Good versus Evil, but as the natural conclusion of an amoral historical process.</p> <p>Let the record show that if the good Lord sees fit to challenge me with great wealth, I will cheerfully pay every penny of tax that I owe, donate heaps of money to people who probably want my taxes to be even higher, <em>and</em> use whatever is left over to splurge on a bigger house, vacations on Cape Cod, a nice set of china and silverware, tasteful dress clothes, and whatever other creature comforts would not make my Yankee forebears blush. And if that prompts anyone to call me a white-wine-swilling liberal elitist, I can only respond, <i>&#8220;L&#8217;chayyim!&#8221;</i></p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s talk for a few minutes about copyright. Copyright, you see, is the right to copy. That&#8217;s why they call it <em>copy</em>right. Unfortunately, some people, even people I generally respect, don&#8217;t copy this idea. <p>For example, <a href="http://www.pandagon.net/mtarchives/002622.html">Jesse Taylor is upset</a> at the prospect of <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-decency23jun23,1,842779.story?coll=la-home-business">legislation that would authorize DVD &#8220;sanitizing&#8221; services</a>, such as <a href="http://clearplay.com">ClearPlay</a>. The movie industry is up in arms over DVD sanitizers, and <a href="http://www.eff.org/legal/cases/Huntsman_v_Soderbergh/">both sides have been duking it out in court for at least a year</a>.</p> <p>Taylor complains: &#8220;If the government can allow my copyrighted property to be sold in an altered fashion without my approval&#8221;&#8212;Stop right there. Your <em>copy</em>right to what you write does not give you an <em>alter</em>right. If you let me make a copy of something that you wrote, and then I alter it, without copying it, then I am in the right, because I made no copy. Right?</p> <p>Elsewhere, <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jeffdillon/20040618#the_gpl_needs_updating">Jeff Dillon is offended</a> that Google uses Linux, and has modified Linux, but it has not made these modifications public. Linux is of course distributed under the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.html">General Public License</a>, but since Google never gives a copy of their modified Linux to anyone outside of Google, the GPL doesn&#8217;t oblige them to show their modifications, no matter how much money they make by using them. Dillon sees this as a flaw in the GPL; he would like future versions of the license to force Google, or other companies that build services on top of GPL-licensed software, to give more back to the community.</p> <p>Dillon says: &#8220;In today&#8217;s world, a fair percentage of the software being used is not being distributed to the client&#8221;&#8212;Stop right there. The authors of Linux have a <em>copy</em>right in the code they wrote, but their copyright does not give them a <em>use</em>right. If I want to restrict the <em>use</em> of software I write, then I have to make contracts with everyone who gets a copy of it, and if I catch someone misusing a copy, I have to prove that they consented to a contract and are now violating it. By contrast, if I put software under GPL, and someone copies it in a way that violates its terms, I have a much easier case. Whether or not the copier consented to the GPL, I have the copyright, and if they can&#8217;t prove I gave them the right to make their copies, they are not in the right. Copy?</p> <p>On alternate Tuesdays, I would admit that ClearPlay and Google are not entirely right. It <em>is</em> kind of silly to believe that you can improve a movie by stripping out the &#8220;profanity, nudity and gory violence&#8221; from it; if the film is worth watching at all, the naughty bits are important for appreciating it. And since Google has hired some of the best computer programmers in the business, and made megabucks off of their work with Linux, they <em>should</em> make good on their VP&#8217;s promise to <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/06/21/1087669904427.html?oneclick=true">&#8220;give something back&#8221;</a>.</p> <p>But that has nothing to do with copyright. Copyright is the right to copy. If the principles behind copyright are truly important to you, you shouldn&#8217;t use &#8220;copyright&#8221; to refer to any wrong that doesn&#8217;t involve copying. Right?</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>This morning, I discovered that the /home partition on my mail server (a venerable 486 in our basement) was full, much to the consternation of <a href="http://cr.yp.to/qmail.html">qmail</a> and <a href="http://www.inter7.com/index.php?page=courierimap">courier-imap</a>. I cleaned up my home directory on that server and everything seemed to be working again. My wife reported that she didn&#8217;t notice any problems with her own mail due to the problem, but she has had less spam than usual. <p><tt><sarcasm></tt> This gives me a wonderful idea for a spam-filtering technique: for 12 hours out of every 24, simply block all incoming email connections on your server. For legitimate users who send mail to a blocked machine, their ISPs&#8217; mail servers will simply try again in a few hours, but the bulk-mail senders that spammers use probably won&#8217;t bother, because those programs are designed for people who want to fire off a few million messages and move on before they can be traced. Sure, any email that you care about receiving could be delayed for some random length of time, but that&#8217;s the price you pay for <em>reducing incoming spam by half</em>. Or you could block those connections for 18 hours out of every 24, and reduce incoming spam by two-thirds&#8230; <tt></sarcasm></tt></p> <p><tt><serious-digression></tt> As <a href="http://cr.yp.to/im2000.html">D. J. Bernstein observes</a>, one of the fundamental flaws in Internet email is that the recipient (or the recipient&#8217;s ISP) is responsible for storing his or her own mail. It would make much more sense for the sender (or the sender&#8217;s ISP) to take responsibility for storing messages and simply tell the recipient, &#8220;the next time you read your mail, there&#8217;s a message waiting for you to download at such-and-such a place&#8221;. If the Internet worked that way, then spam would be much less of a problem, because any message could be traced back to a server under the sender&#8217;s control with a permanent Internet connection, and the person owning that connection could be held accountable. And the odds of <em>ever</em> getting the whole Internet to make such a radical shift in the way it uses email are &#8230; well, about equal to the odds of getting all the spammers to give up their trade out of the goodness of their hearts. <tt></serious-digression></tt></p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>On Sunday, we attended a Court of Honor for a friend of ours who was being invested as an Eagle Scout. The honoree belongs to one of the Scout troops for observant Jews. <p>After the ceremonies, <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/lucretia_borgia/">my wife</a> and <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/queendeb/">the fledgling eagle&#8217;s sister</a> worked up the courage to ask one of the Scoutmasters: could you be a pagan Scout? (One would think that Druids would have a particular interest&#8230;) The Scoutmaster told us that there weren&#8217;t enough pagan troops to create a religious emblem for pagans, like the <a href="http://www.scouting.org/awards/religious/awards/16.html">Ner Tamid</a> for Jews, but there were a number of <a href="http://www.scouting.org/awards/religious/awards/28.html">Zoroastrians</a>. We can infer by the <a href="http://www.jargon.8hz.com/html/Z/Zero-One-Infinity-Rule.html">Zero-One-Infinity Rule</a> that if a religion that believes in <em>two</em> deities is kosher with the Boy Scouts of America, then a religion with a pantheon of any nonzero size is kosher.</p> <p>Indeed, a little Googling turned up <a href="http://eagle.webpipe.net/scouts.htm">a Boy Scout troop in Utah</a> (apparently defunct) that was sponsored by <a href="http://eagle.eagleut.com/">a community that worships the traditional Northern European gods</a>. (If the members of this troop spend too long hiking, do they get Thor feet?)</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>In response to Korach&#8217;s rebellion, Moses tells God, &#8220;Do not pay attention to their gift; I have not taken one donkey from them, and I have not harmed one of them&#8221; (Numbers 16:15). I pointed this out to my wife, contrasting it with Samuel&#8217;s statement on his deathbed, &#8220;Answer me, before the Eternal and his anointed: whose ox did I take? Whose donkey did I take?&#8221; (I Samuel 11), and she expounded it as follows: <p>This verse gives us the clue about <em>what</em> Korach and company are rebelling against. They&#8217;re not objecting to, say, the civil code that Moses has transmitted from God, or the organization of judges to hear claims that one Jew may have against another. They&#8217;re objecting to the <em>tax structure</em> that requires them to give a certain portion of their wealth to the priests. (A midrash quoted and translated <a href="http://www.netivot-shalom.org.il/parshaeng/korach5762.php?">here</a> has Korach telling the Israelites a sob story about a widow who tried to eke out a living and was frustrated at every turn by the restrictions that Aharon placed on her property.) Moses essentially told God, &#8220;By setting my relatives up as members of this privileged class, you are creating this appearance of impropriety, so you have to do something to solve this problem.&#8221;</p> <p>But without this institution of communal sacrifices, supported by tithes from everyone in the community, what would people have done? There would still be sacrifices, but people would only be sacrificing their own animals on their own altars for their own needs. And if everybody could perform sacrifices to God in private, then a person wouldn&#8217;t need much temptation before offering a sacrifice to an idol on the side, just to play it safe.</p> <p>(By contrast, when Samuel is challenging people to identify any of their property that is in his hands, he is reminding them of his warnings about what would happen when the Jews got the king they were nagging him for.)</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>The essential form of the <i>yeshivishe drash</i> is this: First, present a <i>kashe</i>&#8212;two statements from the same canonical text that seem to contradict one another. Then, present the <i>teretz</i>&#8212;an interpretation of both statements that resolves the contradiction. <p>Take the following verse, a statement from the spies regarding the Land of Israel: &#8220;It is a land that devours its inhabitants, and men of stature comprised the whole nation that we saw there&#8221; (Numbers 13:32). Contradiction!</p> <p>The medieval commentators, of course, noticed the <i>kashe</i>, and provided various <i>teratzim</i>. Rashi, citing a midrash (Sotah 35a), says that God caused many Canaanites to die while the spies were passing through the land, so that the natives would be so busy burying their dead that they wouldn&#8217;t notice the spies; thus the remark about the land devouring its inhabitants. Nachmanides and Sforno interpret the spies as saying that the food, water, and air in Israel are so poor that <em>only</em> giants can survive there.</p> <p>But there is another interpretation possible: that the spies <em>were</em> contradicting themselves. They were not trying to present a rational argument for turning around and going back to Egypt: they were trying to manipulate the emotions of their audience. With such rhetoric, it&#8217;s more important to be emotionally consistent than logically consistent.</p> <p>Unfortunately, when Joshua and Caleb tried to rebut the other ten spies, they were <em>not</em> emotionally consistent: they &#8220;tore their clothes, and said to the whole congregation of Israelites: &#8216;The land that we passed through to scout, the land is very, very good&#8217;&#8221; (14:6&#8211;7). It was <em>logically</em> consistent for them to tear their clothes in sorrow over the revolt that the other spies were fomenting, and then speak with optimism about the Land of Israel. But these two actions were not <em>emotionally</em> consistent.</p> <hr> <a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/yo/judaica/parshat/shelach/tzitzit.html">Last year</a>: How are tzitzit supposed to prevent you from sinning?

<![CDATA[<p>The parsha of <i>Beha`alotekha</i> begins with details about the special duties of the tribe of Levi (Numbers 8). A little later, it describes how the tribes marched in formation (10:11&#8211;28). Then, there is the conversation between Moses and Chovev (a.k.a. Jethro), where the latter, despite Moses&#8217; urgings, decides to go home to his own family. A few verses after that, we have the episode with the quail, which begins as follows: &#8220;The <i>afsafsuf</i> in their midst had a great craving, and even the Israelites sat and cried, &#8216;Who will give us meat?&#8217;&#8221; (11:4). <p>The commentators agree that the <i>afsafsuf</i> here is the <i>`erev rav</i>, the &#8220;mixed multitude,&#8221; that left Egypt alongside the descendants of Jacob (Exodus 12:38). What do these people have in common with Jethro? <em>They did not belong to any tribe,</em> and the pageant described in the preceding chapters does not define any role for them.</p> <p>It can&#8217;t be a coincidence that the <i>`erev rav</i> started causing trouble so soon after the most prominent local convert took his leave, can it? My wife suggests two possible reasons:</p> <ol> <li>Jethro was a role model and leader for the <i>`erev rav</i>, and once he left, rowdier elements of the group took over.</li> <li>The native-born Jews in the desert were becoming less friendly to converts; Jethro dealt with the changed attitude by politely taking his leave, and the <i>`erev rav</i> dealt with it by becoming more militant.</li> </ol></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Paul Hanley<br />
 President<br />
 <a href="http://www.ramada.com/Ramada/control/home">Ramada Franchise Systems, Inc.</a><br />
 1 Sylvan Way<br />
 Parsippany, NJ 07054 <p class="mtb">Dear Mr. Hanley:</p> <p>We stayed at the <a href="http://www.ramadachicagohotel.com">Ramada Inn Lake Shore</a> (4900 S. Lake Shore Dr., Chicago IL) this past weekend (check-in June 4, out June 6; two adults plus a toddler) for the Gordon-Dumas wedding. We assumed that booking a room at a hotel in a nationally known chain would assure us of a reliable reservation for a clean room that would be reasonably quiet at night. On all three counts, the Ramada failed us.</p> <p>The mother of the groom checked in on Wednesday, June 2, discovered that the Ramada had lost her reservation, and called to warn us. When we checked our own status, we discovered that the Ramada had two reservations for us, both wrong. The first reservation had been made through <a href="http://www.hotels.com/index.jsp">hotels.com</a> before we knew of a wedding rate, and was cancelled in May. The hotels.com Web site confirmed that the reservation had been cancelled, but the Ramada Inn Lake Shore knew nothing of the cancellation, and we had to ask hotels.com to fax another notice to the Ramada. The second reservation had been made at the wedding rate by calling the Ramada Inn Lake Shore reservation desk, but when we asked for a faxed confirmation, the reservation in the Ramada&#8217;s computer was for only the second of the two nights we had requested. When we arrived, we discovered that the Ramada had lost the reservation for a third family. Since their last name was unique among the wedding attendees, we know that the Ramada did not simply confuse them with the many other &#8220;Gordon&#8221; and &#8220;Dumas&#8221; reservations that had been made for that weekend.</p> <p>When I made the second reservation, I requested a refrigerator for the room&#8212;traveling with a toddler is far easier if you can keep food cold and ready for breakfast and snacks. Roxanne, the Ramada&#8217;s liaison with the wedding party, told me that the hotel didn&#8217;t reserve refrigerators in advance, but there were &#8220;quite a few&#8221; to go around, and &#8220;it shouldn&#8217;t be a problem&#8221; for us to obtain one. When we checked in, the person at the desk couldn&#8217;t tell us whether or not one was available, and said that one would be delivered if it was. Because we had brought refrigerated food for our son, we ended up taking the fridge that the mother of the groom had obtained several nights before. She had been given to understand that the one she had was the last one.</p> <p>We checked in at the Ramada and were assigned room #340, which smelled like stale urine. The friend who had picked us up at the airport commented that it smelled like a &#8220;flophouse.&#8221; When we complained about the odor to the registration desk, we were offered room #337 instead, but it smelled even more strongly of urine. Since other relatives had told us that the Ramada was completely booked by then, we decided to keep our original room, asked them to clean it again, and opened the windows. (If we had not been staying at the Ramada for a family wedding taking place there, we would have checked out immediately and moved to the nearest hotel with a room open, regardless of cost.) At that time, we asked for an additional set of towels and toiletries, since the standard two towels, one soap, and one shampoo were not enough for two adults and a child.</p> <p>When we came back to the Ramada about four hours later, the room still stank of urine, but also had a perfumed odor. We also noticed that our bathroom floor was sticky as we walked on it. Finally, we traced the smell to the bedspread. After this was replaced, the room smelled considerably better, though there was still a strong urine odor in some corners of the room, apparently coming from the carpet. I had call down to the desk again to obtain the additional towels, soap, and shampoo we had asked for several hours before.</p> <p>(My wife commented, as we waited at O&#8217;Hare for our flight home, that the women&#8217;s room there smelled far better than the Ramada had. She was not joking. Doesn&#8217;t the Ramada wash the bedclothes between guests? I can understand how the housekeeping system could let one stained bedspread through the system by accident, but how could two rooms be cleaned so poorly?)</p> <p>As we unpacked, we discovered that the bureau and night-table drawers were stained inside with mold, so we could not safely put clothes in them. I need not remind you that urine and mold residue is not merely unaesthetic but a health hazard.</p> <p>We were told by one of the other wedding attendees that the mother of the bride had checked in late Thursday night, and was placed in a room &#8220;with every type of pestilence&#8212;mosquitoes, roaches, other bugs.&#8221; She had apparently been told there was no other room available, though once the groom came to the Ramada and insisted, she was moved to another room. Since we saw no insects in our room, perhaps we should count our blessings.</p> <p>Friday night until 6:00 p.m., and Saturday starting at 11:30 a.m., we were treated to loud sounds from men working on the low roof just below our window. We could either close the window and suffer the stench more acutely, or open the window and suffer noise sufficiently loud that we had to raise our voices to be heard across our own room.</p> <p>The wedding reception was held in the Ramada&#8217;s conference center. We would characterize the facilities there&#8212;particularly the ladies&#8217; room, with three stalls (one handicapped) serving the guests from two simultaneous weddings&#8212;as very poor, and the catering service provided at the wedding as likewise very poor. Wedding guests should not have to use the bathroom to get water glasses refilled. However, complaining about that is the prerogative of the bride and groom.</p> <p>Saturday night at about 8:00 p.m. we were treated to loud stomping and banging from the room directly overhead. This was particularly disturbing as we were trying to put our child to bed, and he was repeatedly startled from sleep by the loudest thuds. By 9:00 p.m. this had shifted to loud talking, laughter, and cheering, along with music loud enough to vibrate our ceiling. Our neighbors overhead were obviously having a party, not just a loud radio. I went to the Ramada&#8217;s desk to complain, and was told it would be dealt with. When after about 20 minutes the music and voices were still incredibly loud, my wife went to the desk to complain and ask for a manager. She was told that there was no night manager, and that they had &#8220;called up the room but no one had answered.&#8221; Well, of course, she pointed out, the music was too loud for anyone to hear the phone. (They finally sent someone up, and the noise eventually subsided.) I cannot fault the Ramada for having noisy guests, but I expect the desk staff at any hotel to take reasonable and prompt steps to stop unreasonable noise.</p> <p>At 9:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, when we checked out of the Ramada, we discovered that there were no luggage carts available. While we weren&#8217;t the only ones checking out, there was no general exodus at that hour on a Sunday morning. My wife, who has stayed at hotels for conferences, has never had a problem obtaining a luggage cart, even when many guests were checking out at the same time.</p> <p>We have slept at many hotels over the years, including youth hostels, no-name motels, and &#8220;economy&#8221; chains. Our experience at the Ramada is the worst that either of us has ever had.

<![CDATA[<p>Last Wednesday was what the cool kids call my &#8220;blogiversary&#8221;, the anniversary of <a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/yo/meta/hello-world.html">the first scintillating nugget of prose</a> that appeared on this blog. In honor of this august occasion, I will, for this one posting, drop the pretense that I don&#8217;t care about how many people are reading my work. <p>I wrote a crude one-line script that digs through my Web server&#8217;s access logs, picks out the hits in a given month that are most likely from actual human beings reading the site rather than spiders or other bots, and counts the unique IP addresses that the hits are coming from. Here are the results for the year ending May 31:</p> <p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://dynamic.ropine.com/img/hits04.gif"></p> <p>(22 people read this blog via its LiveJournal syndication feed, and about 20 others read it through other syndicators. However, I suspect that most of these readers, at some point during every month, click through to see the continuation of an article directly on the Web site.)</p> <p>If we assume, conservatively, that most people who read <i>yesh omrim</i> read it both at home or at work, and some people have dynamically assigned IP addresses, then every IP address represents a little under half a reader, so we had at least three hundred readers in May. Compared with, say, <a href="http://extremetracking.com/open;unique?login=eschat">Atrios</a>, that&#8217;s small potatoes, but I don&#8217;t think I could <em>name</em> three hundred people who know me personally, so I must be doing something right here.</p> <p>Thank you all for coming! Please let me know how I can serve you better! And remember, a permalink to a <i>yesh omrim</i> posting is low in carbs, complements any decor, and is made from 100% recycled electrons. It&#8217;s the perfect gift for all your friends, relatives, and e-mail lists.</p> <p>OK, back to the pretense.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<blockquote>And this is what the people of the age of the Flood used to do: When a man brought out a basket full of lupines, one would come and seize less than a <i>perutah</i>&#8217;s worth and then everyone would come and seize less than a <i>perutah</i>&#8217;s worth, so that he had no redress at law. <p class="quotecite">(Genesis Rabbah 31:5, translated and cited <a href="http://www.aish.com/torahportion/moray/These_Are_The_Laws.asp">here</a>)</p> </blockquote> <p>I was reminded of this midrash when I read <a href="http://www.newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/politics/national/features/9221/index.html">Alexandra Polier&#8217;s account</a> of how the John Kerry sex-scandal-that-wasn&#8217;t, in which she was rumored to have had an affair with the senator, changed her life. In the article, she demonstrates her journalistic skills by following the rumors back to their source:</p> <ol> <li>Polier expressed interest in working for Kerry&#8217;s campaign, got free tickets to one of his fund-raisers, and had dinner with the senator and several of his advisors. She dated Kerry&#8217;s finance director for a few months.</li> <li>A close friend of Polier&#8217;s, observing how quickly Kerry returned one of Polier&#8217;s phone calls, &#8220;got excited and told friends about it.&#8221; One of those friends, apparently, was Bill Jarrell, a Republican lobbyist. Either the friend or Jarrell interpreted this behavior as evidence that something skanky was going on. (You see, in the rarefied world of Republican policy wonks&#8212;and apparently, <a href="http://tnr.com/etc.mhtml?pid=1717">some Democratic wonks as well</a>&#8212;no senator would <em>ever</em> talk to a twenty-something woman with an interest in politics for <em>any</em> reason other than, you know, wink wink, nudge nudge, say no more.)</li> <li>Chris Lehane, a Democratic dirty-tricks specialist who left the Kerry campaign to work for Wesley Clark, may have also been shopping the rumor around.</li> <li>Stephen VanDyke, a 25-year-old computer programmer in Atlanta, <a href="http://watchblog.com/thirdparty/archives/000780.html">posted the rumor to WatchBlog</a> on February 6.</li> <li>The <a href="http://drudgereport.com/">Drudge Report</a> picked up the rumor (not necessarily from WatchBlog) on Febraury 12. Drudge did not mention Polier by name, but other reporters knew who he was talking about.</li> <li>The next day, <i>The Sun</i>, a British tabloid, ran an article by Brian Flynn who named Polier and, according to Polier, fabricated quotations from her parents. (When Polier tried to interview Flynn, he referred all of her questions to <i>The Sun</i>&#8217;s PR office, and the tabloid&#8217;s PR manager refused to comment.)</li> <li>Drudge linked to <i>The Sun</i>&#8217;s story, seeing it as confirmation, and more respectable media outlets (the <i>Times</i> of London, the <i>New York Post</i>, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> Web site) picked it up from there.</li> </ol> <p>In a world where libel attorneys work for free, Polier would have a slam-dunk case against every person mentioned in this list. In most contexts, <a href="http://www.hfac.uh.edu/comm/media_libel/libel/defense.html">a journalist who quotes a libelous statement, even if the quotation is accurate, is committing another libel</a>. But every link in this chain of rumor-mongering could say, &#8220;Well, by the time <em>I</em> published the rumor, lots and lots of people knew about it from other sources, and <em>other journalists</em> spread the rumor to an even wider audience after they picked it up from me, so even if we are all liable for damaging Polier by spreading this falsehood, <em>my share of the liability</em> should not be very great.&#8221; Furthermore, I suspect that if Polier has any ambition left for a career in journalism, she knows that being a plaintiff in a libel suit would hurt her employability even more than being the involuntary star of a sex scandal. Even if she doesn&#8217;t care about that, how much can she expect to gain from winning a lawsuit, compared to the time and money it would cost her to prosecute it?</p> <p>And so the merchant sees her property leak away, penny by penny, until there is nothing left and nobody worth suing, and our generation is one step closer to the generation of Noah&#8217;s flood.</p> <p class="via">see also <a href="http://www.camworld.com/archives/001265.html">Camworld</a>, <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/the_kerry_intern_hoax_/2004/06/alex_polier_speaks.php">Mark A.

<![CDATA[<p>Maimonides&#8217; discussion of the laws of the <i>sotah</i>, a married woman suspected of idolatry, starts as follows (<abbr title="Mishneh Torah">MT</abbr> Hilkhot Sotah 1:1): &#8220;The jealousy that the Torah speaks of, &#8216;and he became jealous of his wife,&#8217; is when he says to her before witnesses &#8216;do not seclude yourself with so-and-so&#8217;&#8230;&#8221; <p>Oddly, the first Torah verse quoted in this legal code is <em>not</em> the first Torah verse in the section describing the laws of the <i>sotah</i>. That section begins as follows (Numbers 5:11&#8211;14):</p> <blockquote>The Eternal said to Moses: Speak to the Israelites, and tell them: Whenever a man&#8217;s wife goes astray and defiles with an act of defilement&#8212;that is, a man had sexual intercourse with her, and it was hidden from her husband, and they were in secret, and she became impure, and there was no witness with her, and she was not raped&#8212;and a spirit of jealousy came over him, <i>and he became jealous of his wife</i>, and she had become impure; or a spirit of jealousy came over him, <i>and he became jealous of his wife</i>, and she had not become impure&#8230;</blockquote> <p>From the literal Hebrew text, it seems like the wife is <em>expected</em> to be <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/usa/edwin-meese/">guilty</a>, and the possibility that the husband&#8217;s suspicion is misplaced is almost tossed aside as an afterthought.</p> <p>But even if every husband who subjects his wife to the <i>sotah</i> ritual has ironclad evidence of her guilt, why would the wife, who knows what she is guilty of, say &#8220;Amen, amen&#8221; to the priest&#8217;s curse? From the plain text, we see that the ritual requires her cooperation, and from the halakha (<abbr>MT</abbr> Hilkhot Sotah 2:1), we know that a woman can accept divorce without <i>ketubah</i> to avoid going through the ritual.</p> <p>The answer comes from the <em>last</em> verse in this section of the Torah (Numbers 5:31): &#8220;The man will become clean of sin, and that woman will bear her sin.&#8221; What sin does the <em>man</em> become clean of? The Talmud quotes a Baraita that explains (Sotah 28a): &#8220;In a time when the man is clean from sin, the water tests his wife; if the man is not clean from sin, the water does not test his wife.&#8221; If the husband himself has had any prohibited sexual relations, whether prohibited by the Torah or by the Sages, then the adulterous wife will not die (<abbr>MT</abbr> Hilkhot Sotah 2:8).</p> <p>If the wife survives the ritual, she has publically announced that <em>either</em> she is innocent of adultery and her husband has been jealous for no good reason, <em>or</em> that her husband has been misbehaving as well. The more the community suspects her of illicit behavior, the more they will come to suspect her husband of the same offense. For his hypocritical jealousy, the husband is punished measure for measure.</p> <p>(Last year: <a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/yo/judaica/nazir.html">A note regarding the nazirite</a>)</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>&#8220;So have you found something to blog about the parsha yet?&#8221; <p>&#8220;Well, I have a <i title="question">kashe</i>, but no <i title="solution">teretz</i>.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the <i>kashe?</i>&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;The text reminds us of Nadav and Avihu getting toasted (Numbers 3:4), and right after that (3:11&#8211;4:20) it goes on about all the special duties of the Levites to serve as assistants to the priests. I feel like there must be some connection, but I don&#8217;t know what it is.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a warning to the Levites. Duh!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Duh?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Because of all their duties connected with the <i title="Tabernacle">Mishkan</i>, they are at particular risk for stepping out of line. The regular Israelites are too distant from the sacrificial activities to be likely to do anything, and the priests are trained for their work. For the Levites, as they say, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing&#8212;as we see later on from the story of Korach (15:1&#8211;10), a group of Levites who wanted to take over the priesthood. If they remember what happened to Nadav and Avihu, then they&#8217;ll be less tempted to step outside the limits of their roles, even as they see the priests doing the sacrificial service all around them.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Oh, yeah.

<![CDATA[<p>Why would so many people sacrifice money, effort, and social respectability, even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000035P98/102-4394536-5500924?v=glance">risking their lives</a>, defying rules that society has laid down for members of their sex&#8230;so they can follow rules that society has laid down for members of the other sex? I mean, if you&#8217;re going to get yourself in trouble with the Gender Police, why not be <a href="http://www.skirtman.org/gallery.html">straightforward</a> in your rebellion?</p>
	<p>People who answer this question use clinical terms like &#8220;gender identity,&#8221; or clich&eacute;s like &#8220;a woman trapped in a man&#8217;s body.&#8221; Kosse Phillip Feral, an <abbr title="female-to-male">FTM</abbr> transsexual, <a href="http://members.macconnect.com/users/s/salomona/ftm/westfield.html">told a filmmaker</a>: &#8220;The way I explained it to [his children] was I&#8217;ve always felt like a boy on the inside and the outside didn&#8217;t match the inside&#8230; They&#8217;re just little kids so they can relate to I&#8217;ve always felt like a boy or I&#8217;ve always felt like a girl.&#8221;</p>
	<p>Statements like this are obviously directed to an audience that includes non-trans people, and they imply that everyone in the audience, trans or not, adult or child, <em>has a gender identity</em>. I&#8217;m expected to read Feral&#8217;s remark and think: <i>Ah, yes, I feel like I&#8217;m a man, and I&#8217;d be pretty damn distressed if, given that feeling, I had breasts and a vagina and people kept referring to me as a woman. Therefore, I can understand how someone who <em>is</em> in that situation is a human being deserving of sympathy and respect, not a pathological weirdo.</i></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my problem, though: I agree with the &#8220;human being deserving of sympathy and respect&#8221; part, but everything that comes before it trips me up. I know what it feels like to have a penis. I know what it feels like to spend my childhood with other boys indoctrinating me into Appropriate Masculine Behavior. I know what it feels like to be told that it&#8217;s good for me to go into elementary education, because I&#8217;d be providing little kids with a &#8220;male role model&#8221; in the classroom, and then discover that without a spouse making substantially more than myself, I can&#8217;t make enough as a teacher to pay off my student loans and live in Boston. (Not that I&#8217;m, y&#8217;know, bitter.) I know what it feels like to think, <i>well, a sundress would probably be a lot more comfortable than pants in this 90&deg; weather, but I&#8217;ll never know, because if I go out dressed like that I would be risking my job security if not my physical safety</i>.</p> <p>But I don&#8217;t know what it feels like <em>to be a man</em>. Or, for that matter, a woman. At least, I think not. Do I have the emotion that Feral talks about, but label it with different words? Am I like one of those incredibly closeted people who call themselves &#8220;asexual&#8221; to avoid labelling themselves as &#8220;gay&#8221;? Or am <em>I</em> the pathological weirdo here&#8212;not because of my gender identity, but because my <em>lack of gender identity</em>? To sort out these questions, I have been on a quest to isolate this mysterious &#8220;gender identity&#8221; that so many people take for granted.</p> <h1>Mommy, this strange man is deconstructing me</h1> <p>So what is gender identity, in terms that an AI, an alien, or a cripple like myself can understand? It can&#8217;t be the desire to have a penis or vagina, since <a href="http://www.firelily.com/gender/diane/surgery.html">some trans people are content to keep the genitals they were born with</a>. It can&#8217;t be the desire to conform to a male or female gender stereotype; as Colt Illicit points out, <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/coltillicit/10186.html">you can be an FTM trans <em>and</em> enjoy all sorts of non-&#8220;masculine&#8221; pastimes</a>.</p> <p>C.I. suggests that there is a spectrum of gender identity, similar to the Kinsey scale of sexual orientation, in which most people are somewhere in the middle. With all due respect, I think he&#8217;s fallen into a taxonomic trap: confusing gender <em>identity</em> with conformance to a gender <em>role</em>. If you look at how well people conform to the stereotypes of their gender, you&#8217;ll see a pretty wide distributions. But when people are asked what sex they are, they almost always choose one side or the other, not a point on a continuum. C.I. has &#8220;met many ftm men&#8230;who enjoy doing female drag,&#8221; but he calls them &#8220;ftm men&#8221;, not &#8220;80%-men-20%-women&#8221;.</p> <p>We need to disentangle gender identity from gender role-conformance. How?</p> <h1>The curious incident of the girlfriend in the bio</h1> <p>Typically, a woman&#8217;s intimate, platonic friendships with her &#8220;girlfriends&#8221; are important parts of her emotional life. These friendships are radically different from anything that most men have experienced; when I read Margaret Atwood&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385491026/qid=1083207422/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-4394536-5500924?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Cat&#8217;s Eye</a>, the women there, in the ways they manipulated one another, might as well have been aliens from one of those &#8220;sociological&#8221; science fiction novels.</p> <p>I am led to wonder: do <abbr title="male-to-female">MTF</abbr> transwomen have these kinds of relationships with other women, especially non-trans women? Do they not feel any need to form such relationships? Do all of their close friends know their medical history, changing the dynamics of the relationship? Even after reading a number of autobiographies (near the bottom of <a href="http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TSsuccesses/TSsuccesses.html">Lynn Conway&#8217;s &#8220;Successes&#8221; page</a>, there are a few dozen links), I have no clue; the topic just doesn&#8217;t seem to come up.</p> <p>This absence of information is, in itself, informative. I assume that the people who write these autobiographies value their non-trans female friends, and put a lot of effort into maintaining those friendships, but they must not consider the friendships relevant to their lives <em>as trans people</em>. By contrast, <a href="http://www.otherbear.com/jt.html">descriptions</a> of the <a href="http://members.ozemail.com.au/~ghostv/astonished.html">physical</a> and <a href="http://www.transsexualtransition.com/Hormones.html">emotional</a> effects of hormones are standard components of <a href="http://transsexual.org/mystory.html">this genre</a>. And this is a demographic group that is willing to spend <a href="http://www.transsexualtransition.com/expenses.html">tens of thousands of dollars</a> for various medical procedures not covered by insurance, not to mention the thousands of hours they devote to learning how to &#8220;pass.&#8221; So why isn&#8217;t friendship with women part of the standard &#8220;MTF trans success&#8221; story? As they say in the Talmud, <i>mai nafka mina</i>, what&#8217;s the difference between them?</p> <p>Here&#8217;s the difference: the unwritten rules of how to be a girlfriend are <em>specific to women</em>, but <em>getting recognized as a woman</em> does not depend on following them. Suppose that Alice and Barbara are girlfriends, and Barbara, unbenownst to Alice, is a transwoman. If Barbara violates Alice&#8217;s expectations of how a girlfriend should act, Alice might consider her less of a friend, or wonder at her poor social skills, but Alice is not going to <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0104036/">suddenly realize</a>, or even suspect, anything about Barbara&#8217;s gender.</p> <h1>In my arrogant opinion</h1> <p>Here&#8217;s my theory: gender identity is the desire, as an end in itself, to <a href="http://www.kastlfamily.com/articles/passing.html">pass</a>: that is, to <em>be recognized by other people,</em> even <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=toddler+test+group:soc.support.transgendered&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&group=soc.support.transgendered&selm=5g7asv%24h8b%40brtph500.bnr.ca&rnum=5">toddlers</a>, as unambiguously belonging to a certain gender, for most of your day-to-day life. (I say &#8220;as an end in itself&#8221; to exclude, say, a 19th-century woman who dresses as a man so she can join the army.)</p> <p>I think this theory fits what I have been looking for in my quest. It reflects the fact that most people, trans or not, seem to know what their internal gender is. The theory doesn&#8217;t make identity depend on genitalia, since most people who see you will decide your gender without looking at your crotch. The theory doesn&#8217;t make identity depend on role conformance: you can break every standard of Proper Femininity you ever learned, but as long as you want people to recognize you as a woman, you clearly have a female gender identity. The theory marks <em>me</em> as a pathological weirdo, but hey, I&#8217;m weird for all sorts of reasons, no harm in adding one more.</p> <p>(A corollary is that <em>if</em> we lived in a culture where <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0807046159/qid=1085079248/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-2092850-5517537?v=glance&s=books">a child could change his or her social gender without stigma</a>, hardly anyone would seek sexual reassignment surgery. I realize that this corollary is both controversial and unprovable.)</p> <p>I think this theory has some interesting political and sociological applications, but before I go on to those, I need a reality check. All of you readers who <em>do</em> feel like you have a &#8220;gender identity,&#8221; whether or not it matches your physical body: how well does the description in my words connect with what you feel in your guts?</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>In this week&#8217;s parsha, we have the <i>tochachah</i>, the list of punishments for persistently refusing to follow God. This list does not only include <em>physical</em> and <em>spiritual</em> pain, but also <em>emotional</em> pain: <blockquote>For those of you who are left, I will put fear in your hearts, while you are in your enemies&#8217; homelands, and you will flee from them. You will run from the sound of a falling leaf as if running from a sword, without any pursuer. You will stumble over each other, as if from before a sword, without any pursuer, unable to stand up to your enemies. And I will sweep you away [from one another &#8212;Rashi] in your enemies&#8217; lands, and your enemies&#8217; homeland will consume you. (Leviticus 26:36&#8211;38)</blockquote> <p>A person can endure a tremendous amount of physical suffering, if they believe they are doing it for some higher purpose; if they are unaware of any other way to live, then they might not perceive it as suffering at all. On the other hand, someone who is not striving for any goals (perhaps because, as verse 15 says, they &#8220;detest My decrees and distance themselves from My laws&#8221;), or is acutely aware of how other people are doing better than themselves (perhaps because they are living in exile), can feel deprived even in the midst of luxury. As <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/1915">Paul Krugman observed</a>: &#8220;I know quite a few academics who have nice houses, two cars, and enviable working conditions, yet are disappointed and bitter men&#8211;because they have never received an offer from Harvard and will probably not get a Nobel Prize.&#8221;</p> <p>Most people who read this blog don&#8217;t long so acutely for a Nobel Prize, but we all enjoy a standard of living that, in purely physical terms, would be the envy of ancient kings. But this fact gives us little consolation. Whenever we look at the newspaper and wonder how secure we are, physically or economically, we are feeling one of the curses mentioned in this parsha. Because of our sins, we are not only cursed to <em>live</em> in exile, but to <em>feel</em> exiled. And for that reason, we should envy those Jews of ancient times who, if only for a few years, enjoyed the blessing &#8220;you shall eat your fill of bread, and live securely in your homeland&#8221; (26:5).</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>A running theme through <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A8575-2004May7?language=printer">the testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Friday</a> is the assurance, by Rumsfeld and his colleagues, that the military justice system is working on the torture issue. They use this assurance to give themselves political cover in two ways. First, they say that the wheels of justice have been grinding&#8212;slowly, but ever so fine&#8212;since January. Quoth Lt.&nbsp;Gen. Lance L.&nbsp;Smith, Deputy Commander of the United States Central Command: <blockquote> <p>Some have asked why it took so long for the allegations to make it up the chain of command. One needs to look at this as a legal proceeding. Once the allegations were made, the investigation was initiated immediately. Evidence was gathered, people were questioned, and a number were removed from their posts.</p> </blockquote> <p>Second, they can excuse themselves from answering any hard questions about responsibility for the abuses by delegating that job to the court-martials that will be convened, umm, any month now. Quoth Gen.&nbsp;Richard B.&nbsp;Meyers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff:</p> <blockquote> <p>I took an oath to support the Constitution and with that comes the responsibility to ensure that all military members enjoy the full protections of our Constitution, to include the due process of a fair, judicial system. After all, it&#8217;s respect for the rule of law that we&#8217;re trying to teach and instill in places like Afghanistan and Iraq.</p> <p>So like the secretary said, we are now in the middle of a judicial process regarding detainee abuse. And because of my position, I have to be careful I don&#8217;t say anything that can be interpreted as direction or pressure for a certain outcome in any of these cases.</p> <p>Moreover, we have to understand that a fair judicial system takes time to work. I know you all understand that. So no one is stalling or covering up information, but it&#8217;s absolutely essential to protect the integrity of our judicial system.</p> </blockquote> <p>The best response to this theme came from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton:</p> <blockquote> <p>[L]et me just quickly reference the case of Chaplain Yee, the Muslim Army chaplain from Guantanamo Bay who was arrested and placed in solitary confinement. Ultimately all of the charges were dropped after his reputation was sullied.</p> <p>It&#8217;s obvious that the information about this particular case came from government sources. It was pushed out and it was widely disseminated.</p> <p>So, Mr. Secretary, how is it that a case with no basis in fact gets such widespread publicity, based on information from government sources, while egregious conduct like that at the Abu Ghraib prison is cloaked in a classified report, and is only made available when the investigation is leaked to the press?</p> </blockquote> How, indeed? Secretary Rumsfeld could not find time to answer this question.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s parsha, in the middle of a variety of other rules for how the <i>cohanim</i> and their sacrifices need to be fit their respective roles, we have this commandment: &#8220;Do not slaughter a steer or sheep and its child on the same day&#8221; (Leviticus 22:28). The Mishnah (<i>Chullin</i> 8:3) goes on to say that during certain times of the year, when it can be assumed that anyone who buys an animal is going to slaughter it immediately, the seller has to tell the buyer, &#8220;I sold its dam to be slaughtered&#8221;, or &#8220;I sold its young to be slaughtered.&#8221; <p>This mitzvah has a significant consequence for any Jewish farmer or meatpacker: <em>the responsibility to know the family relationships of the flock</em>. If all your cattle look alike to you, then on any day that you slaughter two of them, you are at risk of violating this commandment.</p> <p>For most of the commandments in this parsha, <i>kedushah</i> is achieved by separation of <em>categories</em>. For the purpose of marriage, divorc&eacute;es are separate from <i>cohanim</i>. Blemished animals are separate from the category of &#8220;animals fit for sacrifice.&#8221; Shabbat and the holidays are separate from the ordinary days of the week. But for this one commandment, we achieve <i>kedushah</i> by distinguishing each animal as an <em>individual</em>, with its own heritage.</p> <p>Happy Mother&#8217;s Day!</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>A few days after 9/11, I wrote <a href="http://ropine.com/wtc/orwell.html">an essay to vent my outrage</a> at some of the rhetoric coming from Noam Chomsky and other intellectuals of &#8220;the Left.&#8221; The essay began: <blockquote> <p>When I was a yeshiva student in Israel, a classmate told me of a tour he had taken in Hebron. As the tour bus passed a certain monument, the guide had said: &#8220;This is the grave of Dr. Goldstein, who was killed by the Arabs. &#8212;Not that I&#8217;m defending what he did&#8230;.&#8221;</p> <p>This is the postmodern response to a politically inconvenient atrocity. When someone affiliated with your favorite cause does something indefensible (e.g., when Baruch Goldstein, a Jewish resident of the West Bank, kills 29 Arabs in cold blood in a mosque during Ramadan), it can be hard to deny that the atrocity happened at all, or argue that it is actually a good thing, or insist that someone else had their finger on the trigger. But you can always utter the appropriate platitudes of shame, in as few words as possible, and direct the audience&#8217;s attention to the convenient atrocities, i.e., those committed by your enemies.</p> </blockquote> <p>Chomsky demonstrated his mastery of this form with his brief note <a href="http://www.zmag.org/chomnote.htm">&#8220;On the Bombings&#8221;</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The terrorist attacks were major atrocities. In scale they may not reach the level of many others, for example, Clinton&#8217;s bombing of the Sudan with no credible pretext, destroying half its pharmaceutical supplies and killing unknown numbers of people (no one knows, because the US blocked an inquiry at the UN and no one cares to pursue it). Not to speak of much worse cases, which easily come to mind&#8230;</p> </blockquote> <p>Professor Chomsky, meet <a href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/thomas1.asp">Cal Thomas</a>, former spokesman for the so-called Moral Majority:</p> <blockquote> <p>Let&#8217;s get the preliminaries out of the way first: If members of America&#8217;s armed forces violated any rules and mistreated prisoners of war, they should be punished in accordance with accepted military law.

<![CDATA[<p>A quick note (because, alas, I haven&#8217;t had the time to compose anything better) on last week&#8217;s parsha: we all know about the commandment &#8220;do not put a stumbling-block before the blind&#8221; (Leviticus 19:14). The rabbis (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 15b, cited in <i>Sefer ha-Chinuch</i> &sect;232) declare, as one implication of this law, that a Jew should not sell a weapon of war to a non-Jew, unless it&#8217;s so the non-Jew can defend us. Likewise, it is forbidden to sell these weapons to a Jew who will resell it to a non-Jew, or to a Jewish bandit. <p>What are the modern implications of this halakha? Discuss&#8230;.</p></p>]]>

Based on my assessment and detailed analysis of the substandard accountability process maintained by the 800th MP Brigade, it is highly likely that there were several more unreported cases of escape that were probably &#8220;written off&#8221; as administrative errors or otherwise undocumented. 1LT Lewis Raeder, Platoon Leader, 372nd MP Company, reported knowing about at least two additional escapes (one from a work detail and one from a window) from Abu Ghraib (BCCF) that were not documented. LTC Dennis McGlone, Commander, 744th MP Battalion, detailed the escape of one detainee at the High Value Detainee Facility who went to the latrine and then outran the guards and escaped.

A 15-6 investigation by CPT Wendlandt (115th MP Battalion, S-2) concluded that the detainees allegedly escaped by crawling under the wire at a location with inadequate lighting. One detainee was stopped prior to escape. An MP of the 115th MP Battalion search team recaptured detainee #8399, and detainee #7166 was shot and killed by a Soldier during the recapture process. Contributing factors were overcrowding, poor lighting, and the nature of the hardened criminal detainees at that location. It is of particular note that the command was informed at least 24 hours in advance of the 28 upcoming escape attempt and started doing amplified announcements in Arabic stating the camp rules. The investigation pointed out that rules and guidelines were not posted in the camps in the detainees. native languages.</p> <p>[&para;34e] 05 November 03 &#8230; Several detainees allegedly escaped at 0345 from the Hard-Site, Abu Ghraib (BCCF).

A 15-6 investigation by COL Bruce Falcone (220th Brigade, Deputy Commander) concluded that one of the detainees in tier 1A of the Hard Site had gotten a pistol and a couple of knives from an Iraqi Guard working in the encampment.

Investigation by CPT Kaires (310th MP Battalion S-3) concluded that the detainees crawled under a fence when visibility was only 10-15 meters due to fog. Contributing factors were the limited visibility (darkness under foggy conditions), lack of proper accountability reporting, inadequate number of guards, commencement of detainee feeding during low visibility operations, and poorly rested MPs.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Back in the old days, if an Orthodox Jew immigrated to the United States, his or her children were almost guaranteed to drift away from Orthodoxy. In the old country, it was said that in America, &#8220;even the rocks are <i>treyf</i>.&#8221; Fortunately, as the past fifty years demonstrates, there is no such curse on American soil. But there is one place in the world where the ground itself can be ritually impure: the land of Israel. <p>In today&#8217;s parsha, we read the law of the leprous house: &#8220;When you enter the land of Canaan that I give for you to possess, and I place a leprous disease on a house in the land of your possession&#8230;&#8221; (Leviticus 14:35). As the <i>Sefer ha-Chinuch</i> points out, this implies that only a house in land allotted to one of the tribes of Israel can be subject to the disease. The text goes on to say that when a house is confirmed to have leprosy, its stones have to be taken out of the city and put in a <i>makom tamei</i>, a ritually unclean place (14:40). In the entire Tanakh, the phrase <i>makom tamei</i> only appears in this parsha: Rashi interprets it (s.v.) to mean: &#8220;A place which ritually clean things do not touch; the verse teaches you that these stones cause the ground to be impure [even though normally, the ground is never subject to ritual impurity] while they are there.&#8221;</p> <p>This is a halakhic application of a principle that appears over and over again in Torah: the sanctity of the land of Israel is a two-edged sword. Just as living in Israel gives a Jew opportunities to perform <i>mitzvot</i> that can&#8217;t be done anywhere else, failure to live up to God&#8217;s standards can subject one to penalties in Israel that aren&#8217;t risked anywhere else. In the next parsha, God warns the nation: &#8220;Don&#8217;t let the land vomit you out from your defilement of it, the way it vomited out the nation that preceded you&#8221; (18:28). You never heard anyone worrying that their sins against God would get them vomited out of North America.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>When the inauguration service for the priests was finished, &#8220;the glory of the Eternal was shown to the whole nation&#8221; (Leviticus 9:23). Three verses later, with the deaths of Nadav and Avihu (10:2), the nation had a revelation of a different kind. <p>Previously, Jews had defied God out of fear (e.g., of Pharoah in Exodus 14:11&#8211;12) or physical desires (e.g., longing for meat in Exodus 16:3) or theological error (the golden calf incident in Exodus 32:1&#8211;3). But nobody has accused Nadav and Avihu of these failings. According to Rabbi Eliezer (cited in Rashi s.v.&nbsp;Leviticus 10:2), their only mistake was to make a halakhic decision in the presence of their teacher; according to Rabbi Ishmael <i>(ibid.)</i>, the mistake was to enter the Tabernacle after drinking wine. So they had the best of intentions, but because they made some careless mistake about <em>how</em> to serve God, they were toast. Moses and Aaron didn&#8217;t even have the chance to intercede on their behalf before they knew what had happened. Against this background, the dialogue in the rest of Leviticus 10 takes on a more anxious tone.</p> <p>Furthermore, when laying down the law about drinking wine before services, God says it is &#8220;to distinguish <i>[lehavdil]</i> between sacred and secular, and between ritually unfit and the fit&#8221; (Leviticus 10:10). After the catalog of kosher and non-kosher animals, that word appears again: &#8220;to distinguish <i>[lehavdil]</i> between the ritually unfit and the fit, between the beasts that may be eaten and the beasts that are not to be eaten&#8221; (11:47). We&#8217;ve seen this root used before: e.g., the separation between heaven and earth in Genesis 1:6 is referred to as a <i>mavdil</i>. But this is the first time the term is used to describe something that <em>human beings</em> have to do in their daily life.</p> <p>In many aspects of our life, we honor God by imitating Him. As these verses show, one way that we imitate Him is by using our intellect to distinguish between what is and is not permitted. How great is the reward for doing this job well? Just look at how severely Nadav and Avihu were punished were doing it poorly.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>According to the <a href="http://www.charitywatch.org/criteria.html">American Institute of Philanthropy</a>, &#8220;$35 or less to raise $100 is reasonable for most charities.&#8221; <p>By comparison, the Federal government, in its fiscal &#8216;04 budget, plans to spend about $40 billion on &#8220;administration of justice&#8221; and about $10 billion on tax collection, in a total budget of about $3250 billion. So even if we attribute the expense of <em>the entire Justice Department and Federal prison system</em> to the cost of government &#8220;fund-raising&#8221;, it costs the government less than $2 to raise $100. (These figures are from the <a href="http://www.budgetsim.org/nbs/longbudget04.html">National Budget Simulation</a>.)</p> <p>The next time someone tells you that private charities are &#8220;more efficient&#8221; than the government at achieving some worthy goal, remember these figures.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Nathan Newman, in the course of <a href="http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/001637.shtml">his <i>apologia</i> (in the old-fashioned sense) for not being a doctrinaire left-winger</a>, remarks: <blockquote>Maybe it&#8217;s because I know the left crazies, it&#8217;s easier to see the Bush folks in motion, since they have many of the same sectarian characteristics&#8212;unwillingness to work in real coalitions, a binary view of the world into enemies and friends, and a will to fight war endlessly and globally. Which isn&#8217;t surprising since at least part of the New Right, the neoconservatives, have a lineage partly as ex-Trotskyists, just like the Workers World Party. It&#8217;s as if these two parts broke off, one siding with any enemy of the US elite however noxious, the other choosing to bolster any friend of the US elite however evil. Both believe in endless global war and military conflict, just as either side of the divide.</blockquote> <p>This, I think, is the proper lens for viewing <a href="http://nytimes.com/2004/04/14/international/middleeast/14CND-PLET.html?pagewanted=print&position=">Bush&#8217;s endorsement of Sharon&#8217;s plan for semi-withdrawal from the West Bank</a>. Nobody should be surprised that Bush will let Israel keep some of the territory it captured in 1967; any American politician to the right of Dennis Kucinich, were he or she President, would have the same attitude. The novelty here is that Bush is willing to state that attitude so <em>undiplomatically</em>. And for what? Why couldn&#8217;t Colin Powell quietly tell Sharon, &#8220;of course you&#8217;ll be able to keep some of the West Bank, and you won&#8217;t have to let all the refugees from 1948 back in, but you need to give something credible to the Palestinians in return for that&#8221;? Heck, why couldn&#8217;t Bush continue the silence he&#8217;s maintained for the past however-many months, <em>effectively</em> endorsing Sharon&#8217;s behavior without embarassing the diplomats who have to work with their Arab counterparts?</p> <p>Newman has the answer. To the <abbr title="Workers World Party">WWP</abbr>, every Friend Of The Working Class, even <a href="http://www.workers.org/ww/2001/milosevic1108.php">Slobodan Milosevic</a>, deserves unqualified and effusive support. Likewise, for Bush, Sharon is a Friend of America, and deserves the same endorsement. Diplomacy is for wimps.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>So for the past couple of weeks, when I haven&#8217;t been out for Pesach, I&#8217;ve been working on <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/" title="Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations">XSLT</a> scripts for converting an <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> description of a workflow, first into <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML, then into <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/" title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</a> images. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a problem now integrating the two results, and perhaps the geeks who read this blog can help me, or can point me at someone else who can help me.</abbr> <p><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">Each workflow has a bunch of tasks. In the HTML file, each task has a nicely formatted box of text describing the various task attributes, with an &#8220;id&#8221; tag. When one task refers to another, there&#8217;s a <code>&lt;a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/article/internet-explorer-is-a-harsh-mistress#TaskName"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;</code> that does exactly what you&#8217;d expect when I click on it.</abbr></p> <p><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">Now according to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/linking.html">chapter 17 of the SVG spec</a>, any piece of SVG content can be turned into a link. So in the SVG translation of the workflow, every task has a <code>&lt;a xlink:href="otherfile.html#TaskName&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;</code> to the corresponding section of the HTML file. Simple, right?</abbr></p> <p><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">So when I double-click on the SVG file in Windows, <abbr title="Internet Exploit^H^Hrer version 6">IE6</abbr>, and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/main.html">Adobe&#8217;s SVG plugin</a> renders my lovely diagram. When I then click on one of the tasks in the diagram, the browser goes to my HTML page, <em>but doesn&#8217;t scroll down to the particular task that I selected</em>.</abbr></p> <p>Yesterday I spent an hour or two applying my Talmudic skills to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/">the SVG spec</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/">the XLink spec</a>, and <a href="http://www.carto.net/papers/svg/samples/svg_html.shtml">this crib sheet for embedding SVG in HTML</a>, trying different incantations in my XSLT file, clicking, clicking, clicking, usually with the same disappointing result, sometimes with an even more disappointing result.</p> <p>Then I tried copying both the SVG and HTML files to somewhere underneath my Web root, opened the SVG file in my browser with <code>http:</code> instead of <code>file:</code>, and clicked through. Voila! Everything works. Curse Microsoft for their not-quite-orthogonal interface. Problem solved, or at least worked around, right?</p> <p>Of course not.</p> <p>The fellow who assigned me this project pointed out that my stylesheets, ultimately, will be generating javadoc-like documentation for our clients, and it would be unreasonable to require that in order to read documentation generated from files on their own workstation, they have to run a Web server on that workstation.</p> <p>The best workaround I&#8217;ve found so far is to escape the pound sign in the link, so instead of <code>&lt;a xlink:href="otherfile.html#TaskName&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;</code>, the source code says <code>&lt;a xlink:href="otherfile.html%23TaskName&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;</code>. This will make the link appropriately follow-able when I double-click on the SVG file in Windows Explorer, but <em>not</em> when I view it as a Web page served from my workstation&#8217;s Web server.</p> <p>I suppose this is good enough for now, but it feels like a standards-violating hack that&#8217;s going to stop working as soon as Adobe or Microsoft releases the next version of their software. If I had time to refactor my XSL in a major way, I would probably use the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/batik/svgrasterizer.html">Batik SVG Rasterizer</a> to convert the SVG file into a PNG file, and then use an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/objects.html#h-13.6.1">image map</a> to make the tasks on the graph clickable. However, I have it on good authority that our company is associated with these strange people called &#8220;customers&#8221;, and extracting money from them is easier when our software is published according to this thing called a &#8220;schedule&#8221;, so I don&#8217;t know if I have time to redo it this way. Does anyone have any easier-to-implement alternatives?</p> <p>(Well, yes, we could tell our users to get another Web browser, except that <a href="http://mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/">Mozilla</a> and <a href="http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> both hang when they try to run the Adobe plugin, the &#8220;download SVG-enabled Mozilla&#8221; links from <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/svg/">the Mozilla SVG Project page</a> appear to be dead, <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/">Amaya</a> has a butt-ugly interface and doesn&#8217;t render the SVG very well, and <a href="http://xml.apache.org/batik/svgviewer.html">Squiggle</a> has a butt-ugly interface and can&#8217;t follow links to HTML documents. Give the devil his due: for this purpose, Internet Explorer is the least bad alternative.)</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I have in my possession a remarkable book called <cite>The Kuntrus: A Yeshiva Bochur&#8217;s Handbook</cite> (by Rabbi Benzion Klatzko, Moznaim Publishing Corp., 1999). The book is remarkable not so much for its contents (it&#8217;s an advice book for yeshiva high-school students in the black-hat community), but because it provides me with a written corpus of <a href="http://www.aronson.com/shop/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=7_125&products_id=461">Yeshivish</a>, the Yiddish/Hebrew/English collision that is spoken in some parts of the frum world. You may have seen parodies like <a href="http://www.ottmall.com/mj_ht_arch/v21/mj_v21i54.html#COQ">the Pledge of Allegiance in Yeshivish</a>, but this is the genuine article: <blockquote> <p>We wouldn&#8217;t be human if we didn&#8217;t have them. The <i>mussar seforim</i> say that they actually serve a very important purpose. If you didn&#8217;t feel low when thing[s] were going <i>shvach</i>, you wouldn&#8217;t experience the <i>gevaldiga aliya</i> necessary for true growth. It&#8217;s like a roller coaster. Sometimes you have to go downhill in order to speed back up to the top.</p> <p>First things first. In order to get out of a <i>shvacha tekufa</i>, you have to realize that you are in one.</p> <p>There are three ways of discovering this. One is by searching your soul to see if you are <i>tzufrieden</i> with yourself. If you don&#8217;t <span style="text-decoration: underline">feel</span> like you are making steady progress in <i>ruchnious</i>, you probably are in a <i>shvacha tekufa</i>. Meaning, if you feel in your heart that something is not right, it probably isn&#8217;t. <i>Torah</i> makes a <i>mensch</i> feel good about himself. (Even if other people tell you that you&#8217;re learning <i>geshmak</i>, don&#8217;t be fooled. You know yourself and what you are capable of, the best.)</p> <p>The second way to tell is, even if you are not feeling down at the moment, if you remember yourself <i>shteiging</i> much more in the past, you probably are in a <i>shvacha tekufa</i>. The reason you don&#8217;t feel it is that, most likely, you&#8217;ve been <i>shvach</i> for a while already and you have grown numb to your <i>matzav</i>.</p> <p>The third way of knowing, is by going over to someone whom you can trust, someone you can be very open with, and ask him to tell you what he notices about your davening and learning. Tell him not to worry about your feelings, to hit you between the eyes. He&#8217;ll probably tell you what you already know, but this confirmation will make it more <i>l&#8217;maaseh</i>. Of course you have to be willing to be <i>mekabel</i>.</p> <p>As I mentioned before, sometimes a <i>yeridah</i> precedes a tremendous <i>aliyah</i>. As it happens, a <i>chochom</i> who understands this can use it as a powerful weapon against the <i>Yetzer Horoh</i>. Feeling low, <i>goofa</i>, can spur on the <i>chizuk</i> that you seek. It will help you be <i>machlit</i> to become even better than you were before the <i>shvacha tekufa</i> began. You can then be <i>mekabel</i> new things to help you <i>shteig</i>. And the <i>bren</i> that you feel when your <i>aliyah</i> begins to take hold, will life you to all-time heights. Soon the <i>Yetzer Horoh</i> will have <i>charotah</i> that he ever started up with you! I think you all know the feeling I&#8217;m talking about.</p> </blockquote> <p>Words that we all can live by&#8230;.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>At the end of last week&#8217;s parshah, Moses tells Aaron and his sons &#8220;you shall stay at the opening of the Tent of Meeting, day and night, for seven days&#8221; (Leviticus 5:35). On reading that, my wife asked: so if they were eating all of those sacrifices as part of the inauguration service, and they had to stay in front of the tent for a week, how did they go to the bathroom? <p>Fortunately for us, Ibn Ezra asked the same question (s.v. 5:33), answering it thusly:</p> <blockquote>There are those who say that they did not leave for seven days, and they attended to their bodily functions at night. But the proper reading, in my opinion, is that they went out at whatever they needed, day and night. A great scholar said that they dug a latrine in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting, but this is distant <i>[this reading of the text is far from reasonable, or this latrine would have to be far from the tent? &#8212;sethg]</i>. Scripture says, &#8220;The children of Israel wept for Moses [after his death] for thirty days&#8221; (Deuteronomy 34:8), as if there were no minute in which they were not crying [which is obviously not the case], but Scripture [in the parsha before us] says that they were staying at the opening of the Tent of Meeting day and night, meaning that they did not become preoccupied with anything, and they did not go to another place. Likewise &#8220;he shall not leave the Temple&#8221; (Leviticus 21:12), as I shall explain [in my commentary there].</blockquote></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>The Haggadah contains this well-known paragraph: <blockquote>Rabbi Yose the Galilean said: How do we know that the Egyptians &#8230; were struck by fifty plagues at the sea? In Egypt, this is what it says: &#8220;And the magicians said to Pharoah, &#8216;this is the <em>finger</em> of God&#8217;&#8221; (Exodus 8:15), and at the sea, this is what it says: &#8220;And Israel saw the great <em>hand</em> that God used against Egypt, and the nation was in awe of the Eternal, and they believed in the Eternal and in his servant Moses&#8221; (Exodus 14:31).</blockquote> When we were reading that on Tuesday night, one of our Seder guests said, hey, wait a second! A few paragraphs back, <em>another</em> plague was compared to a hand, not a finger: <blockquote><i>With a mighty hand:</i> This refers to the plague. As Scripture says: Behold, the <em>hand</em> of the Eternal will be against the flocks that are in the fields, against the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the cattle and the sheep, a very heavy plague.</blockquote> <p>(OK, all together now: &#8220;Dang, I&#8217;ve been reading the Haggadah for all these years, and I never noticed that! I&#8217;ve got to switch to grape juice for the first cup.&#8221;)</p> <p>Fortunately for us, the Ritva asked the same question, answering it thusly:</p> <blockquote>&#8230;[T]he written verses here are only a support, and the Kabbalah is the fundamental thing. And it is known that &#8220;His burning anger&#8221; is nothing but the little finger of the hand, and this is also the strong hand, but &#8220;the great hand&#8221; has five of the small fingers, and this is a mystery.</blockquote> Our guest believed that the Ritva is alluding to a statement in the Mechilta, that at the crossing of the Red Sea, even the Jewish serving women saw a greater revelation of God&#8217;s presence than Ezekiel saw in his prophecy.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON, April 1 (<abbr title="April Fool's Press">AFP</abbr>)&#8212;President Bush unveiled a plan today to eliminate the entire national debt by distributing it to the American public. <p>In a Rose Garden speech this afternoon, he explained: &#8220;When I ran for President four years ago, I told the American people, you deserve a tax cut, because it&#8217;s your money, not the government&#8217;s money. Well, the same thing is true for the national debt. The debt belongs to you, not some bureaucrat in Washington, and you deserve control over how it gets paid back.&#8221;</p> <p>Under the plan, everyone who loaned money to the United States would have their debt transferred from the government to a randomly chosen private citizen. Since the current national debt is slightly over <a href="http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdpdodt.htm">four trillion dollars</a>, and the US population is about <a href="http://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html">300 million</a>, every American will be responsible for paying back about $14,000, and the federal government itself will be debt-free.</p> <p>When asked about people who can&#8217;t afford to make payments on a $14,000 debt, the President said, &#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important for Congress to authorize another round of tax cuts.&#8221;</p> <p class="via">see also Bush&#8217;s earlier plan to <a href="http://origin.www.johnkerry.com/features/april_fool.html">outsource the debt</a></p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>This is quite a week for teshuvah. On Wednesday, Richard Clarke, the National Security Council&#8217;s former counterterrorism coordinator, shocked the audience at <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A20349-2004Mar24.html">the 9/11 commission hearings</a> by, of all things, <em>apologizing</em>: <blockquote> <p>[Y]our government failed you, those entrusted with protecting you failed you and I failed you. We tried hard, but that doesn&#8217;t matter because we failed.</p> <p>And for that failure, I would ask&nbsp;&#8212; once all the facts are out&nbsp;&#8212; for your understanding and for your forgiveness.</p> </blockquote> <p>In today&#8217;s parsha, we read the laws (Leviticus 4&#8211;5) for the various kinds of offerings that people bring for expiation of various kinds of sin. Isaiah, in this week&#8217;s haftorah, continues on this theme: &#8220;I have erased your transgressions like a cloud, and your sins like a mist; return to Me, because I have redeemed you&#8221; (Isaiah 44:22).</p> <p>And finally, on Wednesday night, it will be the 10th day of Nissan&nbsp;&#8212; that is, exactly six months between the last Yom Kippur and the next.</p> <p>In the rules for sin-offerings, a pattern stands out. For almost every one of these offerings, the text explicitly says that the sacrifice is brought when the sinner <em>finds out about</em> the sin. Knowledge of <em>what you did wrong</em>, not merely a vague suspicion that you are falling short of the mark, is an essential part of the process for teshuvah.</p> <p>This rule contrasts with Job&#8217;s practice of bringing sacrifices on his sons&#8217; behalf, saying &#8220;perhaps they have sinned, and cursed God in their thoughts&#8221; (Job 1:5). There&#8217;s no indication there that his sons believed <em>themselves</em> to be sinning, or that Job did anything to encourage them to be more careful. He acts like a parent making the minimum monthly payment on a son&#8217;s credit card without ever looking at the bill. Repentance, however, is not a bill that we owe God; it&#8217;s a process of self-improvement that we owe to ourselves. Job&#8217;s attitude is not far removed from Paul of Tarsus, one of the founders of Christian doctrine, who claimed that it&#8217;s impossible to fulfill halakha, and therefore we <em>need</em> the alleged sacrifice of Jesus to substitute for even attempting to observe the law. Wrong, wrong, wrong.</p> <p>In modern times, we see a new way to evade the obligation to know our own sins: the political non-apology of &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry <em>if</em> I have offended anybody.&#8221; When a politician says this, it&#8217;s easy to translate: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve done anything wrong, or at least I&#8217;m not going to admit any guilt in a way that would make my lawyer&#8217;s job harder, but I regret that certain hypersensitive people have made a big deal about my behavior.&#8221; But some Jews make a similar error when they approach their neighbors in the days leading to Yom Kippur and say, &#8220;Please forgive me for anything I may have done to you last year.&#8221; OK, if you want to <em>give</em> blanket forgiveness to everyone around you, good for you. But <em>asking</em> forgiveness in this way puts the person you ask in a difficult position. If you&#8217;ve done this in the past, you have six months to come up with a better strategy.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Kevin Drum, <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_03/003540.php">commenting</a> on <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004_archives/000515.html">Brad deLong&#8217;s lament for the days of browser competition</a>, asks the legal question that is central to all the hand-wringing about Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;embrace and extend&#8221; strategy: <blockquote> <p>And yet &#8230; there&#8217;s a critical piece that&#8217;s missing here. It&#8217;s an argument Microsoft makes all the time, but that doesn&#8217;t necessarily make it wrong (although it&#8217;s surely tempting to think so): should judges be the ones to decide which components should be core pieces of an operating system and which ones shouldn&#8217;t?</p> <p>There&#8217;s a minimalist view that an operating system should basically serve up files and not do much of anything else. Virtually no one holds that view anymore, though, and modern operating systems all include sophisticated UIs, loads of network functionality, drivers for a vast array of devices, email, backup utilities, etc. etc. etc. The list grows at a dizzying rate.</p> <p>So: is it reasonable for a web browser to be a core part of an operating system? How about a media player? Both, after all, can be thought of merely as ways of controlling and viewing files, albeit rather sophisticated files served up via the internet.</p> <p>I don&#8217;t really have a good answer for this, but it&#8217;s definitely a question worth taking seriously. Regulating general business practices (bundling, for example) is one thing, but directly regulating what can and cannot be part of an operating system is quite another. It&#8217;s a real headscratcher.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mr. Drum, and anyone else wondering about this question, should read <a href="http://ecfp.cadc.uscourts.gov/MS-Docs/1636/0.pdf">Professor Lee A.&nbsp;Hollar&#8217;s <i>amicus</i> brief</a> in <cite>US v.&nbsp;Microsoft</cite>. A judge who is unfamiliar with how modern operating systems work might have a hard time figuring out when a combination of two programs <em>really does</em> give consumers a benefit that they wouldn&#8217;t get if the programs were sold separately, and when the antitrust defendant is just blowing smoke. (&#8220;See, if you delete this file, the whole system stops working. That proves that the browser is an integral part of the operating system. Can we all go home now?&#8221;) Hollar&#8217;s brief gives both the technical information and a proposed fact-finding procedure to help a court resolve this kind of question.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve set up an account with <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>, a &#8220;social bookmarks manager,&#8221; and set up the blog to include <a href="http://del.icio.us/sethg">my most recent del.icio.us postings</a> in the upper right. When I have enough of those, I&#8217;ll comment out the code for my old sideblog. <p>The good part of this service: del.icio.us generates <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/sethg">an RSS feed</a> for my list-o&#8217;-links, so I don&#8217;t have to hack the sideblog module to add that feature. The bad part: there&#8217;s no support for a &#8220;via&#8221; link to give credit to someone else for finding a page, and the fellow running the site seems <a href="http://lists.burri.to/pipermail/delicious-discuss/2004-March/000157.html">philosophically opposed</a> to adding that feature. But until I write my own PipeDreamBlog software to include every feature <em>I</em> think is important for a weblog to have, this should serve me nicely.</p> <p>If you have your own del.icio.us account, or are inspired to <a href="http://del.icio.us/register">create one</a> (it&#8217;s free!), please let me know about it, so I can add its feed to <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/public/sethg">my own aggregator</a>.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>If you can read the engineering instructions in Exodus 25&#8211;31, as well as the descriptions of how the Mishkan was constructed in Exodus 36&#8211;38, without your eyes glazing over, you are a far, far better person than I am. Fortunately, almost everyone who publishes a translation of the Chumash takes pity on their readers, and includes some helpful <a href="http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/tanach/mishkan/mishkan.htm">diagrams</a> to show (one or more interpretations of) how these things looked when they were built. There&#8217;s even a coffee-table book, whose title escapes me now, that has photographs of a scale model. <p>One thing that isn&#8217;t captured in any of the diagrams I&#8217;ve seen, however, is the <em>light</em>. Neither the Mishkan (a.k.a. the &#8220;Tabernacle&#8221;) nor the courtyard around it had any windows. The <a href="http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/tanach/mishkan/2.htm">Mishkan</a> had two layers of fabric covering its roof and three walls, and some of that fabric draped over the east wall. <a href="http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/tanach/mishkan/3.htm">Inside the Mishkan</a>, there was the Menorah and the incense altar. <a href="http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/tanach/mishkan/1.htm">The courtyard surrounding the Mishkan</a> had no roof and was surrounded by fabric walls, 50% higher than the walls of the Mishkan itself. The sacrificial altar is in front of the entrance to the Mishkan.</p> <p>So when the Cohanim were performing services inside the Mishkan during the daytime, how was the interior of the tent illuminated? Was there plenty of indirect sunlight through the doorway in the east? Or did the Cohanim eat their showbread in the shadows, lit by the flickering flames of the Menorah and the two altars?</p> <p>The second option is, of course, more dramatic and provides better drash-fodder, but after a fifteenth look at some diagrams, I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s correct.</p></p>]]>

Six of them are spiritual guides representing a variety of religions: one Catholic priest, one Baptist, one Chassidic rabbi, and so on. <p>But here&#8217;s the catch: three of the six spiritual guides are atheists <em>pretending to be</em> religious.

<![CDATA[<p>After the calf is made, God tells Moses &#8220;go down, because your nation that you brought up from the land of Egypt has become corrupt&#8221; (32:7). Moses, trying to convince God not to toast the entire nation, says, &#8220;Why should the Eternal&#8217;s anger be aroused against your nation that you brought out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm?&#8221; (32:11). After the most severe sinners in the calf incident are either executed by the Levites or fall victim to the plague, God tells Moses, &#8220;Go up from here, you and the nation that you brought up from the land of Egypt&#8221; (33:1). <p>Sociologists have pointed out that there&#8217;s no such thing as a completely free gift: when you give something to someone else, a relationship is created or maintained. This, I would venture to say, is why both God and Moses refer to the Israelites as &#8220;your nation.&#8221;</p> <p>God tells Moses to &#8220;go down&#8221; because of the actions of &#8220;your nation that you brought up,&#8221; but then declares His intention to destroy the whole people and make a new nation from Moses alone. If Moses is going to be the only one left standing, why should he go anywhere? Why not stay on Mt. Sinai until the smoke clears? Because God is saying, in effect, &#8220;you contributed to making this mess, so you have to participate in cleaning it up.&#8221;</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I generally take a positivist attitude to the mitzvot. For example, some people will look at the commandment against combining meat and milk, and adduce some Deep and Significant Reason for the commandment, e.g., it&#8217;s a symbol of the distinction between life and death. I say we can&#8217;t mix milk and meat because God prohibited it, and prohibiting things for reasons we don&#8217;t understand is part of God&#8217;s job description, His ways are not our ways, His thoughts are not our thoughts, etc. <p>However, sometimes the Torah, in the course of issuing a specific commandment, provides a specific reason alongside it. For example, in the week-before-yesterday&#8217;s parsha, there are detailed descriptions for the vestments of the priests. In the middle of all these engineering instructions, one phrase stands out: after describing the bells to be tied to the hem of the High Priest&#8217;s robe, the text says (Exodus 28:35) &#8220;&#8230;and their sound will be heard when he goes into the sanctuary before the Eternal and when he goes out, so he will not die.&#8221;</p> <p>There are a variety of interpretations of that &#8220;so he will not die&#8221; part, but since we read this parsha on the day before Purim, Nachmanides&#8217; comment seems apropos: &#8220;&#8230;He said that He commanded regarding [the bells] so that they be heard in the Sanctuary, [and the High Priest] would enter before his Master as if with permission, because one who enters the courtyard of the king suddenly has committed a capital offense against protocol, as in the case of Achasuerus (Esther 4:11).&#8221;</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Some doctors in Texas have compiled <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030729205822/http://www.doctorsknowus.com/">an online database of malpratice plaintiffs</a>. They intended this as a service for doctors who want to avoid taking on litigious patients. Since the database does not distinguish between patients who filed frivolous lawsuits and patients who won well-deserved victories in court, it provides the <cite>New York Times</cite> with an opportunity to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/05/national/05DOCT.html?ex=1393822800&en=c057f8bad5cd0c92&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND">remind us why we have malpractice law in the first place</a>: <blockquote> <p>Among other people listed were Dolores and Ricardo Romero of Humble, Tex. In 1998, Mrs. Romero said, her husband, then 40, went into the hospital to have a herniated disk repaired. The operation went awry and he nearly bled to death on the operating table, suffering serious brain damage. Now, he can barely walk or see and needs help feeding himself and using the toilet.</p> <p>The Romeros&#8217;s lawsuit revealed that the surgeon, Dr. Merrimon Baker, was addicted to painkillers, had once left a surgical sponge inside a patient, and on other occasions operated on the wrong hip and amputated the wrong leg. The jury, finding that the hospital acted with malice since it knew of the doctor&#8217;s history, awarded the Romeros $40.9 million. A higher court overturned the malice finding and an appeal is pending.</p> <p>Dr. Baker, who is practicing outside Houston, did not respond to a message left with his office.</p> </blockquote> <p>As a believer in <a href="http://www.davidbrin.com/tschp1.html">the Transparent Society</a>, I suppose this kind of thing is inevitable. Patients (in Massachusetts, at least) can consult <a href="http://profiles.massmedboard.org/Profiles/MA-Physician-Profile-Find-Doctor.asp">a public database</a> of what doctors have lost malpractice suits, so perhaps it&#8217;s only fair that doctors can consult a public database of what patients have filed malpractice suits. But I want to know <em>which doctors have been using that database</em>, so I can take my business to the ones who avoid lawsuits the old-fashioned way, by doing their job right. As the saying goes, sunlight is the best disinfectant.</p> <p class="via">via <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/03/08/0134258">Slashdot</a></p></p>]]>

Oh, come on. <p>Our MBA-in-Chief will tolerate any kind of gross incompetence from his subordinates, except for <em>saying something the boss doesn&#8217;t want to hear</em>. Contrast George Tenet, Director of Central Intelligence, with Paul O&#8217;Neill, former Secretary of the Treasury.</p> <p>When the White House gave up claiming that we would find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq Real Soon Now, it <a href="http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php?id=P45">blamed the CIA</a> for overestimating Saddam Hussein&#8217;s WMD stocks. (The old party line, of course, criticized the CIA for <em>under</em>estimating Saddam&#8217;s menace to the world. But never mind that. Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia.) If the CIA really had been so incompetent as to mislead the President on an issue that he had used to sell a war to the American people, then Tenet should be shown the door. If firing Tenet would be politically dangerous, because he knows where so many bodies are buried, then Bush could have at least found some undersecretary to serve as a fall guy. But no. Tenet, we are assured, has the full confidence of the President.</p> <p>On the other hand, when O&#8217;Neill told Bush that he would not publically support a second round of tax cuts for the wealthy, he was <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/09/60minutes/main592330.shtml">Cheney fired him</a>. And O&#8217;Neill <em>does</em> know where a few bodies are buried: he gave journalist Ron Suskind <a href="http://thepriceofloyalty.ronsuskind.com/thebushfiles/">19,000 digitized documents</a> that crossed his desk during his tenure under Bush. Perhaps Bush, Cheney, and Rove should have seriously considered O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s position that tax cuts were not the right response to a booming deficit. Perhaps, at least, they should have realized that someone with as much political and executive experience as O&#8217;Neill would take the precaution of making a <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PearlHarborFile">Pearl Harbor File</a>, and consider how keeping him happy might be in the Administration&#8217;s political interest. But no.</p> <p>Unless Cheney is hit with a stroke or an indictment, he will be running for VP in the fall. I suspect that rumors to the contrary are being spread by Republicans who are unhappy with the way the country has been going over the past three years, but who can&#8217;t bring themselves to blame the man at the top.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>[Updated: Minor edits.] <p>Due to an accident involving a black hole, the National Reconnaisance Office, and the Verizon Wireless switching network, I found myself talking on my cell phone with my great-great-granddaughter, Chayya Mushka Sunshine Gordon. As soon as I realized that I was hearing a voice from a century in the future, I wanted to ask her for the point spread on next year&#8217;s Super Bowl, but forced myself to make some small talk first.</p> <p>&#8220;So what do you do?&#8221; I asked.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a computer programmer. My company develops networked applications for intelligent textiles.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Cool! That&#8217;s what I do, too.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;They had intelligent textiles in 2004?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;No. I mean, I&#8217;m a programmer.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Oh.&#8221; I could hear the wrinkled nose in her voice. In the background, a bus door opened and closed, and other passengers babbled to each other. &#8220;What&#8217;s it like, being a male programmer?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;You might as well ask what it&#8217;s like to drive a car with an internal-combustion engine. Most of the programmers I know are men.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, without the wrinkle this time.</p> <p>&#8220;Do IT managers in 2104 discriminate against men?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Sex discrimination is illegal nowadays. It&#8217;s just that men don&#8217;t have, you know, the temprament, the right way of thinking, to be good programmers.&#8221; Her tone became more animated. &#8220;Where I used to work, there was a man on my team responsible for the database design, and it was the most <em>incredible</em> mess. To do the simplest thing, I had to spend days trying to figure out where the information was, or how to add something to one table without screwing up five others. I was venting about it to a friend of mine, and she said, &#8216;If you can&#8217;t get a man to put the toilet seat down, how can you expect him to normalize a database schema?&#8217; &#8212;No offense.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;None taken.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;So most of the programmers in the 20th century were men? No wonder they had so much buggy software. Why didn&#8217;t women look for programming jobs? Discrimination?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I assume that&#8217;s one of the reasons. Also, I suspect a lot of girls were turned off to computer classes because they associated programming with math.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;<em>Math?!</em> You have to make up your algorithms and data structures from scratch and prove that they work?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Most programmers haven&#8217;t had to deal with that kind of thing since the 1970s, at least. But the news hasn&#8217;t filtered down to the sixth-graders yet.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just crazy! Programming is all about <em>communication</em>. You have to communicate with the customer to learn about the problem they want to solve, with your co-workers to make sure that all the pieces will building will work together, with the programmers who come after you so they&#8217;ll be able to maintain what you did&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Oh, absolutely.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;And women have always been the communicators in society. That&#8217;s why men always tease us for talking so much. That&#8217;s why women have always been concentrated in jobs that involve communication: teaching, library science, human resources, secretarial work&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>I cleared my throat. &#8220;Funny you should say that about secretaries&#8212;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Oy, I have to go.&#8221; The doors opened again. &#8220;It&#8217;s been great talking to you, but I have to get to my other job now.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Other job?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I work the second shift at the Holiday Inn reception desk. You don&#8217;t think I could pay the rent on a <em>programmer&#8217;s</em> salary, did you?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Some things never change, I guess.&#8221;</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not sure how concerned I should be about <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0335345/">The Passion of the Christ</a>. Jews, of all people, should know that no text is self-interpreting. If millions of people see the movie, and none of them interpret it in a way that does not inspire them to harm Jews, I have nothing to complain about. If some of them consider it an antisemitic movie, but respond by abandoning Christianity, likewise. If some of them <em>are</em> inspired to commit violence against Jews, the actual violence is a matter for the police. <p>Also, I can&#8217;t shake the feeling that Gibson, observing what Christian outrage did for the box-office sales of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0089366/">Hail Mary</a> and <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0095497/">The Last Temptation of Christ</a>, has stoked Jewish outrage to sell tickets.</p> <p>I am sure of one thing, though. If, God forbid, I were a Christian&nbsp;&#8212; especially a Catholic&nbsp;&#8212; I would be <em>very</em> concerned about this movie. After all, if I were a Christian, this gore-fest with feints at &#8220;historical accuracy&#8221; (Aramaic dialogue, but a white Jesus?!) would be purporting to represent <em>my religion</em>.</p> <p>To their credit, some Christians have looked at the movie and recoiled. <a href="http://www.andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2004_02_22_dish_archive.html#107777885354905430">Andrew Sullivan</a>, for example, called it &#8220;some kind of sick combination of the theology of Opus Dei and the film-making of Quentin Tarantino.&#8221; <a href="http://tnr.com/easterbrook.mhtml?pid=1378">Greg Easterbrook</a> compares and contrasts: &#8220;The Gospels emphasize Christ&#8217;s suffering on the cross; Gibson has decided to emphasize Christ&#8217;s suffering via the whip. Strange that Gibson should feel he understands Jesus&#8217; final hours better than the Gospel writers did.&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/01/opinion/01SAFI.html?ex=1393477200&en=b9d26c6071938613&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND">William Safire</a> asks: &#8220;At a moment when a wave of anti-Semitic violence is sweeping Europe and the Middle East, is religion well served by updating the Jew-baiting passion plays of Oberammergau on DVD?&#8221;</p> <p>Then we have the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Office for Film & Broadcasting, whose <a href="http://www.usccb.org/movies/p/thepassionofthechrist.htm">review</a> has the following high points: &#8220;However &#8230; And though &#8230; &#8216;Nostra Aetate&#8217; &#8230; Overall &#8230; However &#8230; However &#8230; Nonetheless &#8230; flaws as well as triumphs &#8230;&#8221; The review concludes by rating the movie &#8220;A-III&#8221;, meaning that <cite>Passion</cite>, like <a href="http://www.usccb.org/movies/l/leftbehindthemovie.htm">Left Behind: The Movie</a>, is appropriate for all adults without reservation, but not for children and adolescents.</p> <p>So what movies does this august body <em>not</em> consider appropriate for any random grown-up to sit back and enjoy?

<![CDATA[<p>I was a good boy (in one respect) this week: I read the whole parsha, twice in Hebrew and once in translation. But I still can&#8217;t think of anything remotely profound to say about it. So I&#8217;m going to crib from one of my favorite comentators, Yeshayahu Leibowitz ztz&#8221;l. The following is excerpted from <cite>Accepting the Yoke of Heaven</cite>, his anthology of divrei Torah that were originally given on Israeli radio and TV. <p>Reb Leibowitz observes that while the whole story of the creation of the world takes up less than 40 verses, this parsha has over 250 verses describing the construction of the Sanctuary and its various utensils. He goes on:</p> <blockquote>The Torah did not come to give man information on the construction of the world, but to tell him something about the significance of the existence of man himself within the framework of the world: and the significance of this is that one must serve God. The world in itself, as we recognize it, was given to us as something that God had created; whatever is&nbsp;&#8212; is, regardless of how man relates to it. That is why all of creation is indifferent in regard to goals, duties, or obligations, and even in regard to man&#8217;s beliefs, views, opinions, expectations, hopes and visions. <p>But this small sanctuary was not a natural given, but the product of human activity in accordance with a <i>mitzvah</i> of the Torah&#8230;</p> <p>That means that only what is related to the tasks imposed on man, and not what is given to him naturally&nbsp;&#8212; i.e., only expresses a demand made upon man, or obligations imposed upon him&nbsp;&#8212; it is this that is of importance and significance. The world and all in it lack significance, and if I know it as we know it from scientific research, there is nothing left for me to ask about my relation to it. But in the world of values, the <i>mitzvot</i> imposed upon man, the obligations that man accepts upon himself&nbsp;&#8212; these are not givens of nature. And this sanctuary, which has no meaning except for the goal of serving God, and man constructs it for that purpose&nbsp;&#8212; it is that which symbolizes the service of God as the highest value&#8230;</p> <p>&#8230;It is not the world in itself that is significant: what is significant is the service of God in the world.</p> </blockquote></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>[Updated.] <p>Nobody seems to put in a good word for slavery these days. When the Confederate States of America was still a going concern, leaders on both the Union and Rebel sides acknowledged that preservation of slavery was the CSA&#8217;s <i>raison d&#8217;etre</i>; today, the South is full of nutbars (and I mean that in the <em>nicest</em> possible way) who apologize for every aspect of the CSA <em>except</em> for slavery, and who insist that freeing the slaves had nothing to do with the War of Northern Agression.</p> <p>Furthermore, back in the early 19th century, when abolitionists declared slavery to be immoral, conservatives had a simple reply: the Bible says it&#8217;s OK. The &#8220;Old Testament&#8221; authorizes Jews to purchase slaves from other nations and keep them indefinitely (Leviticus 25:44&#8211;46); St.&nbsp;Paul told slaves to obey their masters (Ephesians 6:5); ergo, slavery is OK. This line of argument, too, seems out of favor these days.</p> <p>It is possible, however, to take the Bible seriously as a moral touchstone, legalized slavery and all, <em>and</em> be grateful for the Emancipation Proclamation.</p> <p>Consider the economic environment for most of recorded history, i.e., between the invention of agriculture and the Industrial Revolution. Without a modern banking system, the most effective way to accumulate (or liquidate) wealth was to buy (or sell) food-producing real estate. If you didn&#8217;t own any such land, and you or your spouse weren&#8217;t among the very few people who could support themselves year-round with non-agricultural work, you were screwed. In this kind of situation, slavery could be an impoverished person&#8217;s least bad option, especially because during a slack season, even when there was no work to be done, the master was still obliged to feed and house the slave.</p> <p>Thus, last week&#8217;s parsha teaches that a Jewish slave can choose to stay bound to his master &#8220;forever&#8221; (Exodus 21:6)&nbsp;&#8212; but in the jubilee year, when every Jewish family gets back its share of Eretz Yisrael&#8217;s real estate, even this slave goes free (Leviticus 25:40&#8211;41). Non-Jewish slaves were not automatically released because they did not automatically have anywhere to go to.</p> <p>So if slavery was such a good thing back then, why did it stop being a good thing a few hundred years ago, when America was still a primarily agricultural society?</p> <p>The simple answer is that just because the Torah permits something, that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a good idea. The Torah has a positive commandment for how a man should divorce his wife, but that doesn&#8217;t mean every man should do it.</p> <p>An additional reason, however, deserves mention. As <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2003_archives/001447.html">Evsey Domar and Brad DeLong point out</a>, when land in a pre-industrial society is scarce, the wages of free workers, or the shares of sharecroppers, are so low that there&#8217;s no benefit to enslaving them. Thus, in the ancient Middle East, slaves were almost always debtors or prisoners of war; slavery was a by-product of other social institutions, not an engine of the economy. In medieval Europe, similarly, serfdom was legal, but actual serfs were rare.</p> <p>By contrast, in antebellum America, white landowners faced an abundance of cheap land, and the potential for great profits by selling staple products. Free workers would bid up the price of their labor and cut into the landowners&#8217; profits; slaves working on a cotton farm were easy to control. Therefore, the white aristocracy did not merely enslave people who happened to be on the losing side of a war; they (or their agents) made war on other ethnic groups for the sake of capturing and selling slaves, and convinced one another that the victims of these wars, and their descendants, deserved what they got.</p> <p>The Jewish slave-owners of a few thousand years back were not only constantly reminded that their ancestors were slaves in Egypt; they knew that with a run of bad financial luck, or a Jewish military defeat, they could personally end up as slaves. White plantation owners in the South had no such fear.</p></p>]]>

Bush wants to preserve <em>marriage</em> as a heterosexual-only institution, while leaving state legislatures free to authorize civil unions. Kerry, on the other hand, wants to preserve marriage as a heterosexual-only institution, while leaving state legislatures free to authorize <em>civil unions</em>.</p> <p>OK, there is one significant difference: Kerry would want members of civil unions to be eligible for Federal benefits, such as Social Security, on the same terms as married couples. However, since the Republicans are likely to control Congress no matter who wins the Presidential election, any bill proposing to change those eligibility rules would go down in flames.</p> <p>Note to evangelical Christians: Now that both parties have demonstrated their profound disinterest in writing your <em>sexual</em> morals into the law, perhaps you could review the <em>other</em> sins that Jesus called attention to, and decide which party&#8217;s platform is more consistent with Christian morality <em>as a whole</em>.

<![CDATA[<p>Here are some of the questions asked at <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/02/20040218-9.html#15">yesterday&#8217;s White House press briefing</a>. Try writing your own answers, and then follow the link to see if you can spin as well as Scott McClellan. <blockquote> <p>Scott, does the White House stand behind its report issued just nine days ago, the Economic Report, there will be 2.6 million new jobs created this year?&#8230;</p> <p>Well, you say this is a changing economy, and you also said earlier that this report was based on economic data that is now three months old. So would it be wrong for the Democrats, later this year &#8212; if you don&#8217;t meet this 2.6 million forecast of jobs &#8212; would it be wrong for them to beat you on the head about it?&#8230;</p> <p>When you dismissed the premise of John&#8217;s question by saying, people can debate the numbers, let&#8217;s be realistic here, the debate is going on between your Council of Economic Advisors and Treasury Secretary John Snow. Are there people here in this White House who never believed that forecast?&#8230;</p> <p>Can you answer the specific question, though? Was this report &#8212; was the prediction of this many jobs, 2.6 million jobs, vetted prior to publication by the entire economic team?&#8230;</p> <p>That&#8217;s not the question. Was it or was it not vetted by the entire economic team?&#8230;</p> <p>So you don&#8217;t know, or it was, or it wasn&#8217;t?&#8230;</p> <p>Why &#8212; if you&#8217;re suggesting that people will debate the numbers, that&#8217;s kind of a backhanded way to say, oh, who cares about the numbers. Well, apparently, the President&#8217;s top economic advisors do, because that&#8217;s why they wrote a very large report and sent it to Congress. So why was the prediction made in the first place, if the President and you and his Treasury Secretary were going to just back away from it?</p> <p>Then why predict a number? Why was the number predicted? Why was the number predicted? You can&#8217;t get away with not &#8212; just answer the question. Why was that number predicted?&#8230;</p> <p>No, you have not answered. And everybody watching knows you haven&#8217;t answered.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, in polls of likely voters, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/02/18/elec04.prez.poll/index.html">both Kerry and Edwards beat Bush by ten points</a>.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>The Ten Commandments begins: &#8220;I am the Eternal, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the domain of slavery&#8221; (Exodus 20:2). Some medieval commentators were bothered by this introduction. Wouldn&#8217;t it be more appropriate for God to introduce Himself as the creator of the whole universe, instead? <p>No, it wouldn&#8217;t be.</p> <p>Suppose you bought new Ford car, and after a few years driving it, you discover the owner&#8217;s manual in the glove compartment. Flipping through the manual, you come across a warning message: &#8220;Do not drive this car to any Chevrolet dealership.&#8221; If you would feel morally bound by this restriction, because it was imposed on you by the creator of your vehicle, then you might be qualified for a job as a medieval theologian. If not &#8230; you see the problem. Yeah, God created the universe, and now He doesn&#8217;t want me to light a fire on Saturday. Why should I care what He wants? This is where the Exodus comes in.</p> <p>A few verses before the burning bush, &#8220;the Israelites were groaning from their slavery, and they cried out <i>(vayiz`aku)</i>; their pleas from their slavery went up before God&#8221; (2:23). The root <i>z-`-k</i> only appears in one other place in the Chumash, namely, God&#8217;s description of the situation in Sodom: &#8220;The outcry <i>(za`akat)</i> of Sodom and Gomorrah is very great&#8221; (Genesis 18:20). In both places, people are not merely crying out from pain; they are crying out <em>because they are being treated unjustly;</em> in response, God executes judgment on their oppressors.</p> <p>Through our cries, we acknowledged God&#8217;s role, not as Creator, but as Judge. Having done so, it would be hypocritical for us to say &#8220;OK, you were right to trash the Egyptians, thank you very much, but you shouldn&#8217;t punish <em>us</em> for not doing what you want.&#8221; The Israelites in the desert, even when they sinned, understood this principle. Except perhaps for the golden-calf incident, they never said, &#8220;We&#8217;re glad to be out of Egypt, but we&#8217;re going to defy God&#8217;s commandments anyway.&#8221; Whenever they rebelled against Moses, they talked about going back to Egypt&#8212;denying that salvation from Pharoah had given them any benefit.</p></p>]]>

The guy was over his head and out of his league from day one. As proof of his ineptitude, the best presidential candidate I&#8217;ve seen in years, the guy with the most money and best early poll numbers, has failed to take more than 15% of the primary vote. It takes a special kind of incompetence to let that happen&#8230;.</p> <p>Until the launch of his campaign in early 2003, Dean was widely considered to be a New Democrat: a fiscally conservative, socially liberal Governor at home within the <a href="http://www.ndol.org/ndol_ci.cfm?contentid=252207&kaid=128&subid=187">Third Way</a> movement. Even his healthcare plan was designed to achieve consensus&#8230;.</p> <p>Yet, in spite of Dean&#8217;s solid mainstream credentials, Trippi choose to run him as an insurgent. Why? Because that was the only kind of campaign Joe Trippi knew how to run, and to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail&#8230;.</p> <p>For all their talk about listening to the &#8220;grassroots&#8221;, Dean for America was a black hole. In addition to volunteering here in Georgia, I worked on creative projects with other supporters from around the country. The two most common criticisms heard repeatedly from EVERYONE were that DfA was a) very difficult to reach and b) extremely unresponsive. There was no established means of communication even for State group coordinators, let alone the hundreds of creative pros who repeatedly attempted to donate time and expertise to the campaign, much of whose work product was superior to anything coming from <a href="http://www.tmsnewmedia.com/">TMS</a> [Trippi McMahon & Squier, the media firm that produced Dean&#8217;s ads]. Since taking over from Trippi, Roy Neel has tried to open a <a href="http://www.deanport.com/wi/">few</a> channels, but it&#8217;s all too little, too late.</p> <p>&#8230;Knowing what I know now, every time I hear Joe Trippi say &#8220;this is your campaign&#8221;, or &#8220;you made this happen&#8221;, I want to hurl. Because I know how much better we could have done with capable leadership at the top and a little money at the bottom&#8230;.</p> <p>While Internet penetration in the US is around 65%, television penetration is closer to 98%. That&#8217;s 4% more than have telephones. Failure to master TV is still an unpardonable sin in politics. For his part, Trippi believed that money would fix everything&#8230;. But all the money in the world can&#8217;t make up for poorly conceived and sloppily placed TV ads, or for a campaign that is routinely blindsided by news coverage&#8230;.</p> <p>Collectively, the media is a big, hungry animal that lurches at the smell of blood. To blame them for airing the very public mistakes of the Dean campaign is somewhat akin to a matador blaming the bull for, you know, trying to hurt him or something&#8230;. If you can&#8217;t work the beast, then get out of the arena.</p> </blockquote></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Here is the exact wording of <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/religion.htm">an ABC News PrimeTime Poll</a>, taken last week: <blockquote>I&#8217;m going to ask about a few stories in the Bible&#8230;. The story about Moses parting the Red Sea so the Jews could escape from Egypt. Do you think that&#8217;s literally true, meaning it happened that way word-for-word; or do you think it&#8217;s meant as a lesson, but not to be taken literally?</blockquote> <p>Unfortunately, the poll results do not tell us how many people responded, &#8220;The Bible doesn&#8217;t say that Moses parted the Red Sea, you ignoramus.&#8221; Exodus 14:21 is quite clear:</p> <blockquote>Moses extended his hand over the sea, and the Eternal moved the sea with a strong east wind all that night, and He changed the sea to dry land; the waters were divided.</blockquote> <p>Oh, and <i>Yam Suf</i>, the Hebrew name that the Bible uses for the sea that the Jews crossed through, literally means &#8220;Sea of Reeds&#8221;. Whether or not you believe Exodus was written by God, it&#8217;s far from clear that the author was referring to the Red Sea.</p> <p><a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/_/2004/02/the_democrats_god_problem.php">Mark A.&nbsp;R. Kleiman calls this poll &#8220;profoundly depressing&#8221;</a> because 64&nbsp;percent of respondents (with a three-point margin of error) believe that story to be &#8220;literally true.&#8221; Personally, I&#8217;m profoundly depressed about how many people seem to revere the Bible without, y&#8217;know, <em>reading</em> it.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>With all the <a href="http://thesmokinggun.com/archive/janetsuit1.html">outrage</a> directed at Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake, Viacom, CBS, MTV, and the NFL, it&#8217;s a shame that nobody is directing their ire at the real enemy of decency, the root cause of the smut that pollutes our airwaves and degrades the morals of our youth. I refer, of course, to capitalism. <p>Imagine a typical man living in Europe a few centuries ago. If he wanted to get some beer, he would be lucky to have access to more than one neighborhood tavern. The professional guilds, the church, and the government all worked to restrict competition. As Polanyi explained in <a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ipe/polanyi.htm">The Great Transformation</a>, markets in preindustrial societies were always hemmed in to minimize their impact on traditional social forms. Furthermore, if this man wanted to see a forbidden part of a woman&#8217;s anatomy&#8212;say, her elbow&#8212;his best course of action would be to get married. Fornication might be entertaining for the two people involved, but the rest of the community had no incentive to permit it. The same institutions that protected the local tavern from ruinous competition strove to protect the local maidens from ruin.</p> <p>Today, however, dozens of breweries, dairies, soda bottlers, and mineral-water vendors compete without restraint for the attention of every thirsty man and woman. The bourgeoisie does not invest in these companies for the sake of nourishing the public, but for yielding a certain rate of profit. Furthermore, it is now possible and socially acceptable for a man to acquire all the necessities of daily life&#8212;including, in many subcultures, sex&#8212;without binding himself in a vow of marriage.</p> <p>We should not be surprised that in so many industries today, including television and professional sports, managers enlist sexual imagery to sell their products. To the extent that such marketing is effective, it would be irresponsible for them to do anything else. Marketing strategies that test the limits of public taste&#8212;and, by desensitizing the audience, expand those limits&#8212;are part of the inexorable logic of capitalism.</p> <p>The only way to restore modesty to the public sphere is by destroying the economic system that rewards everything but modesty. Bluenoses of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your thongs!</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>The <i>haftorah</i> for last week&#8217;s parsha ends with the song of Deborah, celebrating her victory over Sisera. A few verses at the end (Judges 5:28&#8211;31) caught my attention. Here they are in the new JPS translation: <blockquote>Through the window peered Sisera&#8217;s mother,<br />
 Behind the lattice she whined [gazed?]:<br />
 &#8220;Why is his chariot so long in coming?<br />
 Why so late the clatter of his wheels?<br />
 The wisest of her ladies give answer;<br />
 She, too, replies to herself:<br />
 &#8220;They must be dividing the spoil they have found:<br />
 A damsel or two for each man,<br />
 Spoil of dyed cloths for Sisera,<br />
 Spoil of embroidered cloths,<br />
 A couple of embroidered cloths<br />
 Round every neck as spoil.&#8221;<br />
 <br />
 So may all your enemies perish, O Lord!&#8230;</blockquote> <ul> <li>In the original Hebrew, the spoil for each man is <i>racham rachamatayim</i>. The word <i>racham</i>, &#8220;female captive,&#8221; has the same root as <i>rechem</i>, &#8220;womb.&#8221; As we say in Feminism 101, these women are being reduced to a body part: the <i>Metzudat David</i> says &#8220;they are being called with insulting language by the name of the womb&#8221;. Somehow, I don&#8217;t think Sisera&#8217;s mother imagining these soldiers valuing these women for their ability to bear children. And yet NJPS translates &#8220;racham&#8221; as &#8220;damsel.&#8221; Does this word really have the same connotations to us as the original Hebrew word had to Deborah&#8217;s contemporaries? Or did the translators not have the, umm, <i>cojones</i> to use a more pungent Anglo-Saxon word instead?</li> <li>Sisera&#8217;s mother talks about Sisera getting dyed cloth as his spoil of war, <em>after</em> mentioning the men getting their, ahem, damsels. Does she think Sisera is getting both? Or does she think that even though Israelite women entirely worthy of being ravished by the invading army, her son is not one of the ravishers?</li> <li>A common trope, in poetry about war, is the women on the losing side crying over the death of their sons and husbands. But Deborah doesn&#8217;t envision Sisera&#8217;s mother bewailing her defeat. She envisions the mother <em>imagining a victory over the Jews</em>. Contrast this with the modern antisemite, who <em>imagines defeat by the Jews</em>, concocting theories of a Jewish conspiracy pulling the strings behind all the world&#8217;s ills. If, in the messianic age, the antisemites imagine themselves victorious over the worldwide Jewish conspiracy, and therefore leave us the hell alone, it would be enough for us. &#8220;So may all your enemies perish, O Lord.&#8221;</li> </ul></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>(A week and a half ago, I gave the d&#8217;var Torah for the parsha at my synagogue for seudah shlishit. My talk was thrown together on Saturday afternoon, and I haven&#8217;t had a chance to write it up until now.) <p>The parsha of <i>Bo</i> gives two descriptions of the victims of the tenth plague. When Moses warns of the impending plague, he says &#8220;every first-born in the land of Egypt will die, from the first-born of Pharoah sitting on his throne to the first-born of the maidservant behind the millstone&#8221; (Exodus 11:5). But when the plague actually strikes, the text says &#8220;the Eternal struck every first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharoah sitting on his throne to the first-born of the prisoner in the pit&#8221; (12:29). The commentators, of course, notice this contrast and remark on it. I&#8217;d like to throw a third verse into the mix. Back when God is is still talking to Moses through the burning bush, He says: &#8220;[You will tell Pharoah that] I will kill your first-born son&#8221; (4:23). In this verse, the other Egyptians aren&#8217;t mentioned.</p> <p>The story of the Exodus focuses on the relationship between Moses and Pharoah, but the ordinary Egyptians, like the ordinary Jews, were moral agents as well. How did the ordinary Egyptians exercise their own power of free will? Here are the examples that the text provides:</p> <ul> <li>Pharoah&#8217;s daughter takes pity on the infant Moses, rescues him, and hires a Hebrew nurse for him (2:5&#8211;10). There is no sign, however, that she intends for him to grow up as anything other than an Egyptian aristocrat.</li> <li>Moses, when he goes out among his fellow Jews, encounters &#8220;an Egyptian man beating a Hebrew man&#8221; (2:11). The Midrash says this man was actually one of the Egyptian overseers, but the text does not bother to distinguish him as a particular kind of Egyptian.</li> <li>Before the plague of hail, &#8220;those who feared the Eternal&#8217;s word among Pharoah&#8217;s courtiers sheltered their servants and livestock indoors&#8221; (9:20) but did nothing to help the Jews.</li> <li>When Moses threatens the plague of locusts, the courtiers finally tell Pharoah, &#8220;let the men go and worship the Eternal, their god&#8221; (10:7). Pharoah offers to let only the men go (which, as the commentators observe, is exactly what the courtiers had suggested), and Moses turns him down. The courtiers do not object to this state of affairs.</li> <li>Finally, before the announcement of the tenth plague, the Jews are instructed to borrow silver and gold utensils from their Egyptian neighbors. The text goes on to say that &#8220;the Eternal gave favor to the [Jewish] nation in the eyes of the Egyptians, and the man Moses was also very great in the land of Egypt&#8221; (11:3). This could be read as a sign that the Egyptians are finally coming to respect the Jews. Nachmanides reads it this way: &#8220;the people of Egypt did not hate them on account of the plagues, but &#8230; said, &#8216;we are the wicked ones, doing violence, and it is obvious that God favors you.&#8217;&#8221; (The Egyptians were apparently foreshadowing Noam Chomsky.) On the other hand, if you interpret God&#8217;s &#8220;hardening of Pharoah&#8217;s heart&#8221; as a removal of Pharoah&#8217;s free will (the interpretation that Maimonides gives in <cite>Laws of Repentance</cite>), then it would be reasonable to say that the Egyptians, in their sudden favor for the Jews, are being similarly manipulated. After all, when God had given Abraham the prophecy that his children would be enslaved, He also said &#8220;in the end they shall go free with great wealth&#8221; (Genesis 15:14), and they had to get that wealth somehow.</li> </ul> All in all, not a very impressive sampling. And so, in the tenth plague, God executed &#8220;every first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharoah sitting on his throne to the first-born of the prisoner in the pit.&#8221; The Sforno expounds on this: &#8220;from the greatest sinner of this [nation] to the least sinner of them all&#8221; (s.v. Exodus 11:5). How is the prisoner in the pit implicated as a sinner? Says Rashi (s.v. Exodus 12:29): &#8220;they were happy at the suffering of Israel.&#8221; Every Egyptian had some power to cause the Jews benefit or harm, and for how they exercised whatever power they had, they were called to account.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>For the past few centuries, political-science wonks have known that whenever more than two people are running for the same seat in an election, the way the vote is structured can have a decisive effect on the outcome. For example: In 1992, when Clinton and Perot were running against Bush the Elder, a voter might have preferred Perot to the other two candidates, but preferred Bush to Clinton. On the one hand, since Perot had no chance of winning a single state, and almost every state awarded all of its electors to whichever candidate got the most votes, our hypothetical Perot>Bush>Clinton fan would be tempted to vote &#8220;tactically&#8221; for Bush, rather than split the anti-Clinton vote. On the other hand, by voting for Perot, the voter would send a clear message to both parties. (If Perot hadn&#8217;t won 19&nbsp;percent of the popular vote in 1992, would Clinton have cared so much about reducing the deficit?) In a close three-person race, where each candidate <em>does</em> have a serious chance of winning a plurality of votes, the situation is even more volatile. <p>To ameliorate this problem, the wonks have proposed a variety of alternative voting schemes that let voters clearly express their preferences while still having an influence on the outcome. Since this year&#8217;s Democratic primary has four well-known candidates, I thought it might be interesting to see if different methods of counting the vote could lead to different winners. So I have constructed <a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/cgi-bin/ballots">a Web page with three ballots for you to cast</a>: one ballot that allows you to select only one candidate, one ballot that lets you check off every candidate that you approve of, and one ballot that lets you rank the candidates in whatever order you prefer them.</p> <p>My trusty Web server will then give you the <a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/cgi-bin/results">the results</a> for three different kinds of election: the traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_election_system">first past the post system</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting">approval voting</a> system, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">Condorcet method</a> (specifically, what that page describes as &#8220;Copeland&#8217;s method&#8221;). There is no shortage of other proposals for tallying votes, but considering how much time I spent debugging the SQL for Copeland&#8217;s method, I think I&#8217;ll pass on trying to implement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_Runoff_Voting">instant runoff voting</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_voting">cumulative voting</a>, or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count">Borda count</a>.</p> <p>The polls are open until 11:59&nbsp;p.m., Tuesday, March 2nd, 2004, or until my server melts down, whichever comes first. Please vote now, and please tell your friends about this page.</p> <p>P.S.: Yes, I know, a halfway-competent Perl hacker could write a script that pads the vote totals. If you want to prove that you&#8217;re that kind of 31337 h@x0r, don&#8217;t waste your time with my toy Web site, OK? Go bother the American Family Association or CNN.com or one of those other outfits that takes their online polls seriously.</p> <p>P.P.S.: The Condorcet method is the only technique that&#8217;s immune to the &#8220;tactical voting&#8221; I described above. In an electorate that suffers from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet%27s_paradox">Condorcet&#8217;s paradox</a>, the Condorcet method will not record any winner; the other methods will pick a winner that the majority of the voters don&#8217;t like. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbard-Satterthwaite_theorem">Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem</a>, derived from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem">Arrow&#8217;s impossibility theorem</a>, proves that <em>every</em> voting method that chooses between three or more candidates must either have a dictator or be vulnerable to tactical voting.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Digby has <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2004_02_01_digbysblog_archive.html#107583134589419623">an article that makes the same point I did</a>, and includes some actual figures from Clinton&#8217;s 1992 primary campaign. <blockquote> <p>At least we won&#8217;t have to go through another losing nominating process like the last time we had a large field. In 1992, they didn&#8217;t even hold the New Hampshire primary until the end of February, fergawdsake. Bigtime Loser Clinton won just 3 of his first 14 contests. In fact, he finished fourth four times, often behind &#8220;Uncommitted.&#8221;</p> <p>[read the whole article for the numbers&#8230;]</p> <p>As everyone keeps pointing out to me, that was a long, long time ago. Everything has changed completely. There is no point in even thinking about it, now.</p> <p>Still, there is one important lesson to be learned from the past. By drawing out the primaries the way they did, the Democrats had far too much time to think about who they were voting for and they often voted for someone who wasn&#8217;t a winner. If Bill Clinton couldn&#8217;t win Iowa and New Hampshire, he had no business being the nominee. But, nobody told the voters or the press (who were fixated on Ross Perot at the time) so he managed to eke out the nomination when it was obvious that either Tom Harkin or Paul Tsongas should have run against George Bush.</p> <p>It is a good thing we&#8217;ve learned from our mistakes. We won&#8217;t let that happen again.</p> </blockquote></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>The dame&#8217;s hips were a liberal&#8217;s dream: small on the top, a robust middle class, and a popular base of support. She dropped into the armchair across from my desk. I poured her a shot of Jack Daniels. (After Iowa, the Gephardt boys had gone a little wild, and broke all my bottles of Scotch.) <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, sweetheart?&#8221; I asked.</p> <p>The bell curve of her lower lip shook. &#8220;He&#8217;s dead.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Howard Dean.&#8221;</p> <p>I raised my eyebrows. &#8220;Another plane crash?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I mean, his campaign.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Dead? Says who?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;The news, the blogs &#8230; everyone. Their new campaign manager says they can keep going, even if they don&#8217;t win any states on Tuesday. But when I tell my friends that, they laugh at me and&#8230;&#8221; She downed the whiskey and choked back tears.</p> <p>&#8220;Let me guess. They say something about Kool-Aid and dot-com bubbles, right?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Is it true? Am I crazy to hope?&#8221; Her lips left a mark on the tumbler, red as the 2003 Federal budget.</p> <p>&#8220;Politics is a crazy business, sweetheart. Most of the <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/wh04dem.htm">national tracking polls</a>, there&#8217;s a four-way statistical tie for second: Dean, Edwards, Clark, and Undecided. If Dean is a busted dot-com bubble, then Edwards is a factory on its way to China, and Clark is pinned down in his trench by enemy fire from all sides.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s it? Two states have voted, and Senator Kerry&#8217;s big hair is going to lead the Democrats in November?&#8221;</p> <p>I poured myself another glass. &#8220;Hard to say, sweetheart. On the one hand, Clinton skipped Iowa and lost New Hampshire in &#8217;92, and he went on to be nominated. On the other hand, Clinton had a lot more time between New Hampshire and the next primary to connect with the voters and overcome his bad press. Your man&#8217;s only had a week.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Why is it different this year?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;The Party <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml%3Fi=20020121&s=nichols">decided to compress the schedule</a> two years ago. They wanted to shut down the circular firing squad and pick a nominee as soon as possible, voters or not. Kennedy challenging Carter in &#8217;76, Hart beating on Mondale in &#8217;84&#8212;from Terry McAuliffe&#8217;s point of view, those guys were doing the Republicans&#8217; job, making the front-runners defend themselves against someone in their own party instead of beating the drum against the Republicans.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;But you said yourself, it took the voters a while to warm up to Clinton in the primaries, and he won two terms. And if the circular firing squad is such a bad thing, what have all the candidates been doing for the past year and a half?&#8221;</p> <p>I refilled her glass. It was the best answer I could come up with.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Less than six weeks ago, Jonathan Chait of <cite>The New Republic</cite> created a new blog on TNR&#8217;s Web site, &#8220;Diary of a Dean-o-Phobe.&#8221; In the <a href="http://tnr.com/deanophobe.mhtml?pid=1109">first message</a> of that blog, Chait explained his motivation: <blockquote>Earlier this year I wrote a piece for TNR that defended hatred of President Bush&#8230;. But recently I&#8217;m finding that Dean hatred is crowding out Bush hatred in my mental space. It&#8217;s not that I think Dean would be a worse president than Bush&#8212;he&#8217;d probably be better, although that&#8217;s extremely faint praise given that Bush is the worst president of the last 80 years. Bush is like the next-door neighbor who lets his dog poop on your lawn and his kid shoot bb&#8217;s at your house and who says something irritating to you every day on his way to work. Dean, on the other hand, is like the ne&#8217;er-do-well who&#8217;s dating your daughter. You realize the neighbor is a worse person than the boyfriend, but the boyfriend (and the frightening prospect that he&#8217;ll become your son-in-law) consumes more of your attention.</blockquote> <p>Now Chait is shutting down the blog. With all the news of Dean&#8217;s campaign woes, Chait&#8217;s phobia is receding&#8230;</p> <blockquote> <p>First, obviously, Dean is finished as a potential nominee. He&#8217;s blown all his money, his campaign is in disarray, and he&#8217;s turned to an inside-the-Beltway Democrat to run his campaign. Dean may well play a potent spoiler role, but it&#8217;s almost impossible to see him winning. Even if he somehow pulls out a [plurality] of delegates and goes to a brokered nomination, the other candidates will pool their delegates and select a non-Dean.</p> <p>Second, not only is Dean&#8217;s nomination dead, Deanism is dead as well. By &#8220;Deanism&#8221; I don&#8217;t mean Dean&#8217;s mix of issue positions, or his novel strategy of Internet organizing (which, I hope, will become a model for Democrats in the future). What I mean by Deanism is the belief that some combination of technology and Dean&#8217;s charisma can somehow suspend all the known laws of politics, that liberals can wish away unpleasant facts about the American electorate, and that the failure to do so represents cowardice, betrayal, and the absence of principle.</p> </blockquote> &#8230;to be replaced by another one: <blockquote>Finally, John Kerry takes all the fun out of Dean-o-phobia. Indeed, if there&#8217;s anybody who could make Dean attractive, it&#8217;s Kerry. Kerry is a miserable candidate, bereft of political skills, and possessing of a record and a persona tailor-made for Karl Rove. The Republicans will merely have to say about Kerry what they said about Gore&#8212;that he wants to be on every side of every issue, that he&#8217;s culturally out of touch with mainstream America, that he&#8217;s a pompous bore&#8212;and this time the sale will be easier, because all these things are far more true of Kerry than of Gore.</blockquote></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Last week, I blogged about how Dean was the most electable candidate in the race, and the bastard went and lost an election. I still think that if he went head-to-head with Bush, he would do better than any other Democrat, but if he doesn&#8217;t win some primaries, such what-ifs don&#8217;t matter. There&#8217;s no medal for the guy who would have been the fastest runner if he hadn&#8217;t tripped over his shoelaces in the first lap. <p>No matter how this race turns out for Dean, though, he has revealed something very interesting about how to win elections in America.</p> <p>According to conventional wisdom, in a race with party primaries followed by a general elections, candidates have two constituencies. First, they have the voters who care enough about their party to vote in the primaries. Second, they have the larger pool of voters who turn out for the general election. Primary voters are more likely to be from the party fringes than general-election voters, so candidates have to perform a balancing act. If they are too moderate in the primaries, then they won&#8217;t win over their first constituency. If they are too extreme in the general election, then they won&#8217;t win the general election. If they change their stances too noticeably between the primary and the general election, they will alienate voters from their first constituency who trusted them during the primary.</p> <p>One of Dean&#8217;s admirers at <cite>The New Republic</cite> (Noam Scheiber?) observed that Dean had a novel solution to this problem: he campaigned with the <em>style</em> of a firebrand liberal, but his <em>positions and record</em> were firmly moderate. If he becomes the nominee, he can change his style to attract swing voters, but his hard-core supporters will be comforted by the consistency of his platform.</p> <p>Dean&#8217;s collapse in the polls this month, and his disappointing show in Iowa, however, reveals a third constituency&#8212;or rather, a zeroth constituency: people who are willing to give their money and time to a Presidential candidate before the primaries even begin. Dean&#8217;s style built up an incredible base of support from the zeroth constituency. But once the Iowa caucus neared, he had to make himself attractive to the first constituency, the people who actually voted. Furthermore, in a primary election where all the candidates are trying to increase voter turnout, and where &#8220;electability&#8221; is on everyone&#8217;s mind, the first constituency looks more and more like the second one.</p> <p>The Dean campaign seems to realize their strategic mistake. Dean has made the rounds of late-night TV shows, brought his wife to campaign events, and otherwise strived to look more mainstream; the hard-core Deaniacs are still devoted to him. Will that change be enough to carry him to the nomination? Stay tuned, true believers&#8230;.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>The following table shows, for the four leading Democratic candidates, (a)&nbsp;which ones have certain qualities that, various pundits assure us, improve their chances of picking up votes in the primaries; (b)&nbsp;how they are faring in various tracking polls that were taken over January 21&#8211;23. <table> <tr> <th></th> <th>Clark</th> <th>Dean</th> <th>Edwards</th> <th>Kerry</th> </tr> <tr align="right"> <th>Veteran</th> <td>yes</td> <td>no</td> <td>no</td> <td>yes</td> </tr> <tr align="right"> <th>&#8220;Washington outsider&#8221;</th> <td>yes</td> <td>yes</td> <td>no</td> <td>no</td> </tr> <tr align="right"> <th>Southern</th> <td>yes</td> <td>no</td> <td>yes</td> <td>no</td> </tr> <tr align="right"> <th>No spending cap</th> <td>no</td> <td>yes</td> <td>no</td> <td>yes</td> </tr> <tr align="right"> <th>Did well in Iowa</th> <td>no</td> <td>no</td> <td>yes</td> <td>yes</td> </tr> <tr align="right"> <th>ARG (NH)</th> <td>20</td> <td>15</td> <td>13</td> <td>34</td> </tr> <tr align="right"> <th>Zogby (NH)</th> <td>14</td> <td>22</td> <td>7</td> <td>22</td> </tr> <tr align="right"> <th>Rasmussen (national)</th> <td>14</td> <td>14</td> <td>15</td> <td>31</td> </tr> </table> <p>(&#8220;No spending cap&#8221; is important because it means that Dean and Kerry, who have refused the strings that come with government campaign finance, can spend as much money as they can raise in the primary season, which means they might be buying 30-second commercials after Clark and Edwards have run into the spending caps.)</p> <p>If you&#8217;re a Democratic voter, depending on how much weight you attach to various qualities in a candidate&#8212;and these qualities don&#8217;t have any mapping onto a &#8220;liberal/moderate&#8221; axis&#8212;you could reasonably prefer these four candidates in any order. So even thought Kerry is likely to win the NH primary, that leaves three other candidates competing to become the anti-Kerry. Who will attract the majority of the voters who don&#8217;t go for Kerry? As more candidates drop out of the race, who will their supporters gravitate toward, and will this process lead to someone other than Kerry being nominated?

<![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been obsessing over the primaries all last week when I should have been reading the parshah, so rather than compose a drash about it, I&#8217;m going to borrow somebody else&#8217;s. The following is paraphrased from Rabbi Yehudah Schnall, one of my teachers at <a href="http://darchenoam.org/">Darche Noam</a>. He offers an answer to a question which commentators have argued about for centuries: if God &#8220;hardened Pharoah&#8217;s heart&#8221; to prevent him from liberating the Jews, how is this consistent with the doctrine that every person has free will? What is this &#8220;hardening the heart,&#8221; anyway? <p>Rabbi Schnall, who has a doctorate in philosophy, says that some philosophers distinguish between &#8220;first-order desires&#8221; and &#8220;second-order desires.&#8221; For example, an alcoholic may want to drink (first-order desire), but at the same time want to not want to drink (second-order desire). Generally speaking, when someone feels a conflict between a first-order and a second-order desire, he or she will identify himself or herself with the second-order desire. &#8220;I want to stop drinking, but I just can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p> <p>Now, consider Pharoah&#8217;s response to the plagues. Anyone in his position could see that the cost of the plagues&#8217; destruction outweighed any benefit from keeping the Jews enslaved, and be tempted to free the Jews for the greater good of the Egyptians. But if Pharoah didn&#8217;t believe that freeing the slaves was the <em>moral</em> thing to do, he would feel coerced into doing it, and he would wish he had the strength of character to tell Moses to take a hike. &#8220;I am the absolute ruler of the most powerful nation in the world,&#8221; he would think, &#8220;a deity in my own right, and these descendants of Jacob <em>deserve</em> to be my slaves. If I were a better Pharoah, I wouldn&#8217;t let myself sully the honor of Egypt by freeing six hundred thousand slaves just because my ex-courtier claims to be their god&#8217;s prophet and shows me a few magic tricks.&#8221;</p> <p>And so, the Eternal <em>gave</em> Pharoah enough willpower for that second-order desire to remain in control. At any time, Pharoah was free to recognize God&#8217;s moral sovereignty, free the Jews, and end the plagues. But he chose otherwise.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>It would be bad form to say this on the campaign trail, but the <em>ideological</em> distinctions between the major Democratic Presidential candidates are almost trivial. Dean has been cast as &#8220;the anti-war candidate&#8221; simply because he didn&#8217;t support the blank check that Congress wrote the President in the fall of 2002. Lieberman is supposed to be the most conservative Democrat in the race, but his <a href="http://adaction.org/SenateVR2002.htm">2002 Americans for Democratic Action rating</a> is 95%&#8212;as compared with 85% for Kerry and 30% for Zell Miller (the <acronym title="Democrat In Name Only">DINO</acronym> from Georgia). Any one of these guys would make a better President than Dubya, and any one of them, if elected, will have to compromise his agenda to deal with Republicans in Congress. Thus all the chatter about &#8220;electability.&#8221; <p>I submit that despite <a href="http://tnr.com/deanophobe.mhtml">widespread fears</a> to the contrary, <em>Dean is the most electable Democrat in the race</em>. Consider:</p> <ul> <li>Rove is going to find some way to smear whatever Democrat is nominated, and he is very good at making such accusations stick, no matter how unfair they are. Consider the 2002 Senate race in Georgia, where Republicans accused Max Cleland, who lost three limbs in the Vietnam War, of being insufficiently patriotic&#8212;<em>and they won</em>.</li> <li>A well-functioning mass media would call foul on any candidate who tried to sling mud like this, and keep the voters focused on the candidates&#8217; actual positions and records. No sane Democrat can rely on the press behaving this way in 2004. Consider how, in the 2000 race, reporters were more interested in repeating the lie about &#8220;Gore claimed he invented the Internet&#8221; than in using sixth-grade arithmetic to check Dubya&#8217;s budget proposal.</li> <li>In order to counteract this kind of operation, any Democratic candidate will need a very, very good organization to get his message out <em>in spite of</em> whatever the mass media says about him.</li> <li>In the past two years, Dean has encouraged an unprecedented number of Democrats to open their wallets and volunteer their time for him. Dean followed this path from &#8220;Howard who?&#8221; to &#8220;the man every other Democrat is trying to beat&#8221; <em>without</em> the sort of media lionization that Gary Hart enjoyed in 1984, or that John McCain enjoyed in 2000. You can&#8217;t attribute this success to Dean&#8217;s liberalism or anti-war credentials: Kucinich, who is far more liberal and anti-war, hasn&#8217;t got nearly as much support. You can&#8217;t attribute it to geeks like me being brought in through that newfangled Internet thing: the SEIU, a union for people who vacuum the cubicles of geeks like me, has endorsed Dean. Quite simply, Dean is a very good politician with a very good campaign manager.</li> </ul> <p>The anyone-but-Dean folks in the Democratic Party have a nightmare: Dean gets nominated, he runs a campaign that fires up hard-core Democrats but alienates Middle America, and leads the party to a crushing defeat. This fear is not entirely unfounded, but I have my own nightmare, which goes something like this:</p> <ul> <li>On the first ballot of the Democratic convention, Dean has a plurality, but not a majority, of delegates, and the majority are firmly in the anyone-but-Dean camp. On the second ballot, some other candidate gets the nomination. Dean pledges to work with the nominee and encourages his followers to do the same.</li> <li>Deaniacs in the trenches find themselves hobbled by a campaign organization that isn&#8217;t quite sure what to do with them. (Recall that when Clark finally threw his hat into the ring, some of the grass-roots folks in the Draft Clark movement found themselves shoved aside.)</li> <li>The Republican spin machine turns its slime machine from Dean to the Democratic nominee, and the media follows suit. The nominee finds himself constantly on the defensive, with Bush constantly setting the agenda for how the Democrats are portrayed.</li> <li>Bush wins forty states.</li> </ul> <p>Hopefully, neither of these nightmares will come to pass.</p> <p>God bless America&#8212;and please hurry!</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>(Updated to add proper attribution.) <p>A pregnant woman&#8217;s immune system, which normally treats any unfamiliar cells as a potential threat to be attacked with overwhelming force, has to know <em>not</em> to attack the fetus inside her body. Many scientists are studying the process the immune system uses to make this distinction, especially since, as <a href="http://www.nature.com/nsu/021118/021118-9.html">this <cite>Nature</cite> article</a> points out, failure of the system may be one cause of infertility.</p> <blockquote> <p>In 1989, a young British woman had her ninth consecutive miscarriage.

The text goes on to say that the Canaanites &#8220;said, this is a solemn Egyptian grief; therefore, [the place] is called Grief of Egypt, over the Jordan River&#8221; (50:11). In Egypt, Jacob&#8217;s children had to be separated from the Egyptian population, because Egyptians hated shepherds (46:34). But upon entering Canaan, they&#8217;re treated as Egyptians. <p>I&#8217;m reminded of a complaint by some of the Soviet Jews who immigrated to Israel, back when there <em>was</em> a Soviet Union, and when applying for an exit visa marked a Soviet citizen as a traitor to the motherland: in the Soviet Union, they were Jews rather than Russians; in Israel, they were Russians rather than Israelis.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>OK, everyone and his editor has pontificated about how the Bush immigration proposal is an attempt to convince more Hispanics to vote Republican, because if the Republicans don&#8217;t pick up more non-white voters in the long term then they will lose one election after another, etc., etc., etc. Nonsense. <p>Remember Medicare prescription drug reform, the White House&#8217;s last attempt to curry favor with an important voting bloc? <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/health2.htm">Here</a> is how it&#8217;s <em>not</em> winning them votes:</p> <ul> <li>Back in June, 56&nbsp;percent of adults in a nationwide poll trusted Bush &#8220;a great deal&#8221; or &#8220;a moderate amount&#8221; when it came to setting Medicare policy, and 55&nbsp;percent had the same trust in Congressional Democrats.</li> <li>In July, when Bush&#8217;s plan was being debated in Congress, 70&nbsp;percent of adults thought the plan should pass.</li> <li>In December, after Congress passed it, 32&nbsp;percent of all adults polled approved of it, and 38&nbsp;percent disapproved. In the same poll, <em>47&nbsp;percent</em> of adults aged 65 and older, and <em>46&nbsp;percent</em> of adults 55&#8211;64, disapproved of the plan.</li> <li>In another December poll, <em>56&nbsp;percent</em> of adults aged 65 and older were &#8220;very concerned&#8221; that the program didn&#8217;t go far enough, and <em>58&nbsp;percent</em> were &#8220;very concerned&#8221; that it gave too much to the pharmaceutical industry. Only 30&nbsp;percent were concerned that it would cost the government too much.</li> </ul> <p>See the pattern? The more time voters had to read the fine print on the scheme, the less they liked it; the ones who were purported to benefit the most liked it the least; the most common reasons for not liking it are reasons to vote Democratic in the next election.</p> <p>And with the immigration proposal, there&#8217;s already plenty of fine print to not like. The amnesty (in all but name) offered to undocumented workers is a crock, because it requires their employers&#8217; cooperation. Right now, the occasional INS raid is just a cost of doing business for companies that hire illegal aliens, and as <a href="http://www.prospect.org/print/V14/7/rosenbloom-j.html">this <cite>American Prospect</cite> article</a> illustrates, it&#8217;s not much of a cost. So why should the employers give their workers the right to complain about their boss and not get deported?</p> <p>(Yes, the <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_01_04.html#002376">senior Administration officials</a> made some noise about improving their enforcement efforts against illicit employers. I&#8217;m sure Dubya will offer Congress an INS budget with enough &#8220;internal enforcement&#8221; to make a difference, right after No Child Left Behind is fully funded and Air Force One is escorted by flying pigs.)</p> <p>Bush&#8217;s proposal also includes a new visa category, allowing employers in any industry to bring in temp workers from abroad, after the usual certification that no American resident can be found to do such-and-such a grueling job for the miserably low pay being offered. Who has been lobbying for such a plan? Not the Hispanic voters. As the <cite>Prospect</cite> reported back in <em>July:</em></p> <blockquote> <p>The Essential Worker Immigration Coalition (EWIC) includes 34 employer associations from industries including hotels, health care, construction, janitorial services, meatpacking, amusement parks, retail stores and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Its agenda has some elements that immigrant-rights advocates and unions also support, such as a legalization program for undocumented workers and repeal of employer sanctions, which make it illegal for an undocumented worker to hold a job.</p> <p>But the heart of its agenda are the following two points: &#8220;short-term: an effective h-2b-like program,&#8221; and &#8220;long-term: an employment-based visa that could be converted to permanent residence.&#8221; EWIC co-Chairman John Gay says most industry groups would prefer the second alternative &#8212; creating a whole new visa category for permanent contract workers because the H2-B program is set up for temporary, seasonal employment. &#8220;But it&#8217;s possible that this aspect could be changed,&#8221; he speculates.</p> <p>The coalition combines both legalization and guest-worker proposals because it believes that guest-worker expansion alone would never get the needed 60 votes to defeat a filibuster in the U.S. Senate. &#8220;Organized labor would go ballistic,&#8221; Gay says. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re for the whole enchilada.&#8221; Before September 11, such a compromise was being discussed in the back rooms of Congress.</p> </blockquote> <p>(<a href="http://www.prospect.org/print/V14/7/bacon-d.html">Read the rest</a> to find out how aggressively our government is not protecting the foreign temp workers we already have.)</p> <p>So a President who muffed his attempts to pander to seniors and to steelworkers is now trying to sell an &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; plan that Hispanic voters are unlikely to buy, that will piss off his conservative base because of the amnesty provision, and that will give disgruntled high-tech workers further motivation to work for his defeat. How much more <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/gwbbio.html">unelectable</a> can&#8212;</p> <p>Hey, look! A lunar base!</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Excerpt from the <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_01_04.html#002376">transcript</a> of &#8220;senior administration officials&#8221; briefing reporters on Dubya&#8217;s new immigration-reform proposal: <blockquote> <p>QUESTION And the last thing is, do you mind just elaborating a little bit on the point you made about the rights &#8212; that you said that they will be able to come out of the shadows and have rights that U.S. workers do as far as wages and employment? Do you mind just spelling out how that would work?</p> <p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Right. These people will obviously be on the books, if you will, as opposed to in an underground economy. They&#8217;ll be legally here, working legally here. They&#8217;ll pay payroll taxes, Social Security taxes and the like. As they rent property, they&#8217;ll pay property taxes and buy property and so forth.</p> <p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: They&#8217;ll pay sales taxes when they buy things.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, that&#8217;s a relief. I&#8217;ve always been concerned about how people who entered the United States illegally have been evading the <em>sales taxes</em> that we citizens have to pay.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p><a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim</a> had a sidebar link to <a href="http://www.alpha-geek.com/2004/01/02/example_of_hard_to_parse_html.html">an example</a> of why you should use a real HTML parser, instead of a hodgepodge of regular expressions, to strip out unwanted and potentially dangerous tags/attributes from HTML that you receive. This is a topic near and dear to my heart, because: <ol> <li>When I set up <a href="http://wordpirates.com/">Word Pirates</a>, a site that allows anyone to complain about &#8220;pirated words&#8221; whose meanings are being distorted, I didn&#8217;t do anything to filter the HTML that was received from the outside. Days after the site went live, somebody posted a line of Javascript that redirected it to a porn site.</li> <li>It reminds me of one of my pet peeves&#8230;</li> </ol> <p>In my current job, my most recent project involved a conversion script. One of our products uses a GUI generator tied to a particular database system, using a proprietary language to describe how the input forms on the screen would look and what database fields each screen field was connected to. We want to use a new home-grown GUI system, which is (in theory) database-independent and uses an XML-based language (of course) to convey the same information. My predecessor had written a Perl script to convert from one language to to the other, but the script didn&#8217;t do the whole job; my mission was to improve the script where possible, run it over a hundred or so forms, and then manually clean up as many of them as my co-worker could throw at me.</p> <p>The script that landed in my workstation was an inspiring piece of work. When it processed the forms it received as input, it used regular expressions to identify key words and syntactic constructions. Statements in this proprietary language usually ran across multiple lines, so the script resorted to this sort of technique:</p> <pre> foreach ($line) {   # ...   if (/foobar (.*) begin/) {     $foobar_arg = $1;   }   # ...   if ($foobar_arg) {     # ...     $flag = 0 if /foobar end/;   }   # ... } </pre> <p>(Observe how, if someone had written a form in the original language that said <code>foobar(baz) {</code> instead of <code>foobar (baz) {</code>, the script would become quietly confused and output gibberish.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the <em>output</em> end, I had a two-hundred-and-thirty-line for-loop, containing a two-hundred-line for-loop, which added little bits of text to three different strings as it navigated through a two-dimensional array of the names of keys of multilevel hashes, and then concatenated these strings into an XML file at the very end. Unless, of course, the input had triggered some obscure bug and the script generated invalid XML. And I was proud of myself for refactoring the script until it <em>only</em> had twenty-six global variables. Etc., etc., etc.</p> <p>This project bore a strange resemblance to one of my first projects at my <em>previous</em> job, where I had to extend a Perl script that took an XML file as input and generated a PostScript page with the same information &#8230; using regular expressions to take apart the XML, instead of using the perfectly adequate XML parser that comes free with Perl, so that an extra space or carriage return would throw it into complete confusion.</p> <p>You see, about thirty years ago, a bunch of smart people realized that they had better things to do than construct and debug such monstrosities every time they had a new language to interpret, so they invented <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/manual/html_chapter/flex_5.html">lexers</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_node/Language-and-Grammar.html">parser generators</a>. Every widely-used language has at least a few of these things, free for the taking, that you can use to <em>describe what a language looks like and where to find information in its statements</em>, instead of taking it apart line by line and using regular expressions to perform abominations in the eyes of God and Larry Wall. But hordes of coders out there seem committed to reinventing the flint and steel all by themselves in their own caves, instead of staggering over to the cave that already has a fire going and grunting &#8220;Ogg please borrow Zippo lighter.&#8221; If I had faith in the efficiency of the free market, I would be comforted by the knowledge that as long as so many others were creating these messes, I could make money cleaning up after them, but &#8230; well.</p> <p>Of course, as <a href="http://www.venge.net/graydon/markup-abuse.html">XML hype</a> continues to overtake the world, such convoluted and ignorant use of regular expressions will become rarer and rarer. Instead, we can look forward to convolted and ignorant use of <acronym title="Domain Object Model">DOM</acronym> and <acronym title="Simple API for XML">SAX</acronym>. Rapture!</p></p>]]>

It&#8217;s amazing how little it takes to make one&#8217;s eardrum feel like the lid of a vigorously shaken beer bottle. Ow. Ow.

<![CDATA[<p>According to a well-known midrash, when Joseph asks the cup-bearer to put in a good word for him to Pharoah (Genesis 40:14&#8211;15, in last week&#8217;s parsha), Joseph was exhibiting insufficient faith, and as punishment, God kept him in prison another two years. <p>For a very long time, this midrash bothered me. When we&#8217;re in trouble, does God really want us to sit on our butts and wait for divine intervention to save us? Indeed, citations to this midrash are often accompanied by a hand-waving qualification that of course, <em>someone on Joseph&#8217;s level</em> should have known better than to ask a mere mortal to help him get out of prison, but <em>we poor schmucks</em> should not rely on miracles.</p> <p>Then I noticed the distinction between Joseph&#8217;s interpretation of his fellow prisoners&#8217; dreams (40:12&#8211;19) and his interpretation of Pharoah&#8217;s dream (41:25&#8211;32). When talking to Pharoah, Joseph makes it clear that God is the agent here, using the dreams to tell Pharoah what He will do. By contrast, Joseph tells the baker and cup-bearer, &#8220;Don&#8217;t interpretations belong to God?&#8221; to get them to describe their dreams, but after that, he doesn&#8217;t mention God at all.</p> <p>Furthermore, as a rational strategy for getting sprung, Joseph&#8217;s plea makes no sense. &#8220;I was stolen from the land of the Hebrews&#8221;&#8212;why should Pharoah care? &#8220;I didn&#8217;t do anything to be put in this pit&#8221;&#8212;how many prisoners will actually admit to being guilty? Joseph isn&#8217;t trying to get Alan Dershowitz to help him appeal his verdict; he&#8217;s unburdening his feelings on the cup-bearer, and his predominant feeling is <em>I don&#8217;t belong here</em>.</p> <p>When we are in trouble, we can, and should, use every practical and moral means at our disposal to improve our condition. But our efforts should not make us forget that God is in control of the world.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>After Joseph is sold into slavery, Judah &#8220;descended from his brothers and associated with an Adulamite man&#8221; (Genesis 37:36). As Rabbi Ephraim Buchwald put it, he was fed up with this Jewish dysfunctional family. But why should Judah, of all the brothers, be the one to leave? After all, Judah was the most effective leader in the story: the sale of Joseph was <em>his</em> suggestion. But perhaps his effectiveness as a leader gave him an <em>extra</em> motivation to get away from his brothers; with Joseph gone, Judah had good reason to fear for his own life. <p>Abraham had two sons: one of them was chosen to carry on his mission, and the other was sent away. Isaac had two sons: again, one was chosen, and the other was sent away. Against this background, the rivalry between Jacob&#8217;s sons makes more sense. They have no way of knowing that <em>all</em> of them are going to share in the blessing of Abraham, so when they hear Joseph snitching on his half-brothers (37:2), see Jacob&#8217;s favoratism toward Joseph (37:3), and hear Joseph announce his dreams of kingship (37:4&#8211;11), they have good reason to be concerned.</p> <p>(Note to self: The verse that mentions the snitching <em>immediately precedes</em> the verse that mentions the favoratism. Must see if any commentators pick up on this.)</p> <p>But with Joseph out of the way, there is a more uncomfortable situation: eleven brothers still compete for their father&#8217;s favor, and they can no longer be united by their hatred of Joseph. If the other brothers could conspire to kill Joseph, then they could conspire to kill Benjamin, the other son of Jacob&#8217;s favorite wife. From there, as my lovely and brilliant wife pointed out, Judah would be next in the cross-hairs. Reuben, the first-born, had offended his father after Rachael&#8217;s death (35:22), and his weak response to the plot against Joseph (37:21&#8211;22) doesn&#8217;t demonstrate much leadership skill. Simon and Levi, the next two sons of Leah, had offended their father by how they sacked Shechem (34:30&#8211;31). Judah, as the next one in line, might have decided that he didn&#8217;t want Simon and Levi to know where he lived.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>The Jacob of the last two parshiyot is the consummate deal-maker. He sells his birthright to Esau (25:33). Impersonating Esau, he tells his father, &#8220;eat my game, so that your soul will bless me&#8221; (27:19). His oath to God is conditional: &#8220;if the Eternal God will be with me, and guard me on this road &#8230;&#8221; (28:20&#8211;22). And of course, he offers his labor to Laban in exchange for Rachael (29:18, 27), and then agrees to work further in exchange for the striped and spotted sheep (30:32&#8211;33). Even his wives get into the contractual spirit, when Leah uses mandrakes to buy the right to sleep with Jacob from Rachael (30:15). <p>But here, when he reunites with Esau, he makes no deal: he gives lavish gifts and says it was only &#8220;to find favor in your eyes, sir&#8221; (33:8). What changed?</p> <p>Once Jacob returns to his father&#8217;s house, God has held His end of His conditional oath with Jacob. Jacob&#8217;s success in Laban&#8217;s household fulfills the blessing originally meant for Esau (27:28&#8211;29). With twelve sons, he can pass on the blessing of Abraham (28:3&#8211;4) &#8230; even if he, and eleven of those sons, meet untimely deaths. Jacob has received many blessings, but immortality is not among them.</p> <p>Jacob has nothing to offer God in exchange for a continuation of his good fortune. All he can say is &#8220;I have become small from all the kindness and truth that you have done for Your servant&#8221; (32:11). By realizing the significance of the gifts he received <em>from</em> God, he begins to appreciate the significance of the gifts he can give <em>to</em> his brother.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Hebrew fluency liberates the Jewish mind. Almost every document in the Jewish canon, from Genesis to the responsa, and almost every significant commentary on these documents, is written in Hebrew. Many have never been translated. When they are translated, the translator is not always interested in making the whole text accessible, or in showing the reader all the possible readings of an ambiguous line. The better your Hebrew reading skill, and the broader your experience with classical Hebrew texts, the clearer the window between your mind and the minds of Rebbi, Maimonides, and the Vilna Gaon. <p>OK, not every Jew has the time or ability to become so fluent. You might think, though, that any Orthodox man who aspires to the title of &#8220;Rabbi&#8221; would also want to learn the Hebrew language &#8212; well enough, say, to pass an examination given in Hebrew &#8212; before accepting the title. You might think that even if some aspiring rabbis fell short of this standard, a rabbi with the power to ordain others would not grant the title to a complete stranger who was not fluent. You would be, alas, <a href="http://www.shemayisrael.com/smicha/">mistaken</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>The Shema Yisrael Torah Network of Israel through its worldwide learning network partner Pirchei Shoshanim is developing a plan with the Chief Rabbinate of Israel which will allow those who desire to take the Israeli Rabbinate Semicha exam to do so in English&#8230;.</p> <p>Pirchei Shoshanim&#8217;s incredible staff of talented Rabbanim and writers have developed a process where one can learn Shulchan Aruch in a very methodilogical <i>[sic]</i> manner explaining each and every point and then having it be able to be applied in a practical manner. This has allowed those who have not had the opportunity to study the Shulchan Aruch and work full time to learn as if they have learned these areas their whole life and not disturb their daily routine. Moreover, the project allows those without a traditional Yeshiva or Torah education to now learn and understand as if they had always learned.</p> </blockquote> <p>My rabbi tells me that back in the day, the Rabbanut gave these tests in Yiddish, so I suppose you could spin this news as a return to tradition. But if they&#8217;re looking for leniencies of past generations to reauthorize, I could come up with some better candidates than giving rabbinic exams in the vernacular.</p> <p>It would be a wonderful thing for the Rabbanut to offer the analog of an associate&#8217;s degree, to recognize people who had a considerable amount of Torah knowledge but fell short of the requirements for semichah. I could also understand a school relaxing the traditional semichah requirements for individual students who were outstanding in other respects. But this &#8230; <em>why?</em></p> <p>Fortunately, the sages of Israel have a few standards left. Hebrew fluency has become optional, but a penis is still mandatory. Priorities&#8230;.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>(Sorry, again, for the delay in putting this up. It&#8217;s been one of those weeks &#8230; followed by one of those weekends &#8230; followed by one of those Mondays.) <p>In, umm, last week&#8217;s parsha, Jacob refers to God as the &#8220;<i>pachad</i> of Isaac&#8221; (Genesis 31:42, 31:53). King James, the new JPS translation, and Metsudah translate <i>pachad</i> as &#8220;fear,&#8221; Artscroll translates it as &#8220;Dread&#8221;, and the (Roman Catholic) New American Bible translates it as &#8220;Awesome One.&#8221; To get a sense of the nuances of this word, it helps to have a concordance. Here are some other places in Tanakh where the same root is used (all translations from the new JPS):</p> <ul> <li><i>Terror</i>, and pit, and trap / Upon you who dwell in Moab! &#8212;declares the Lord. (Jeremiah 48:43)</li> <li>I am bringing <i>terror</i> upon you &#8212;declares the Lord God of Hosts&#8212; / From all those around you. (Jeremiah 49:5)</li> <li>For what I <i>feared</i> has overtaken me; / What I dreaded has come upon me. (Job 3:25)</li> <li><i>Panic</i> and pitfall are our lot, / Death and destruction. (Lamentations 3:47)</li> <li>&#8230;And many of the people of the land professed to be Jews, for the <i>fear</i> of the Jews had fallen upon them. (Esther 8:11)</li> </ul> <p>From the various other places where the word is used, it doesn&#8217;t seem unreasonable to translate <i>pachad Yitzchak</i> as &#8220;the mind-numbing terror of Isaac&#8221;. Isaac is the only person who is paired with the word <i>pachad</i> in this way to refer to God. Of course, Isaac is the only person who came within a hair&#8217;s breadth of being sacrificed to God by his own father, so I suppose it&#8217;s understandable that his relationship with God, and nobody else&#8217;s, would be described in these terms.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Some years ago, at a synagogue that shall remain nameless, I came across a surprising <i>d&#8217;var Torah</i>, attributed to a rabbi at Yeshiva University. It said that Isaac&#8217;s behavior and personality reminded the author of developmentally delayed adults he had worked with. The theory intrigued me on a number of levels. <p>First, it makes sense. The theory doesn&#8217;t match the hagiographic style of midrash that is so popular today, and it violates Maimonides&#8217; principle that you need a Ph.D. in theology before God hands you a prophet&#8217;s license. But if you look at the plain text of the Torah, assuming that Isaac was retarded makes a pattern of his life story easier to understand.</p> <p>Except for his prayer on Rebecca&#8217;s behalf and his blessings for his sons, Isaac relied on his memory of how his father behaved to solve every problem he encountered, and never sought to face any challenge that his father had not previously faced. When famine struck Canaan, Isaac wanted to go to Egypt, just as his father had done, and only changed his plan because God told him to. On meeting Avimelekh, Isaac passed his wife off as his sister, just as his father had done. To get Jacob safely away from Esau, Rebecca told Isaac that Jacob should marry a woman from outside Canaan, just as Jacob&#8217;s father had done. If this reliance on memory and trusted advisors was the best that Isaac could do, and God protected him from any circumstance that would have presented him with a challenge that could not be met in this way, then this pattern of behavior is less surprising, and the exceptions tell us even more about Isaac&#8217;s character and priorities.</p> <p>This interpretation also lets us make sense of a perplexing midrash. It says that Sarah died when she heard that Isaac was about to be sacrificed, which would make him 37 years old at that time. (See Genesis 17:17, 21:5, and 23:1, and do the math.) As Ibn Ezra points out, if Isaac was an adult at the time of the <i>Akeidah</i>, then he, not his father, deserves the credit for the near-sacrifice &#8212; yet the text treats the event as Abraham&#8217;s test alone. If Isaac did not have the intellectual capacity to realize what his father was doing, this contradiction is resolved.</p> <p>While this <i>d&#8217;var Torah</i> helped me see the life of Isaac in a refreshing and surprising way, it also reminded me of an issue in the American Orthodox community that is neither refreshing nor, alas, surprising. I cannot name the rabbi who wrote that document, nor recall all its details, because of the circumstances in which I saw it. Some other people in this synagogue were passing it around <em>for the purpose of ridiculing its author</em>. The rabbi, seeing what was going on, ordered them to stop circulating it, and opined that the person on the <i>d&#8217;var Torah</i>&#8217;s byline did not actually write it. These reactions, I fear, speak volumes about the distance between the attitudes of some contemporary &#8220;religious&#8221; people and the faith of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Joseph Telushkin, in <cite>Jewish Literacy</cite>, pointed out that even though the biblical <em>law</em> permits polygamy, the biblical <em>narrative</em> advises against it. Whenever a man in the Tanakh has two wives, it seems to be an unhappy marriage: one wife is beloved but infertile, and the other one is fertile but unloved. We&#8217;ve already seen this happen with Sarah and Hagar; a few weeks from now, we&#8217;ll see it with Rachel and Leah; in Nakh, Hannah (Samuel&#8217;s mother) and Peninah have the same situation (I Samuel 1:1&#8211;8). <p>Against this background, consider what Rebecca says when she meets Abraham&#8217;s steward (Genesis 24:24): &#8220;I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milkah bore to Nachor.&#8221; Nachor not only had a wife, Milkah, but a concubine, Re&#8217;umah (22:24). Why did Rebecca want to make it clear who her grandmother was? The simple explanation is that by announcing that she was descended from Nachor through his wife and not through a concubine, her family would get the better part of his inheritance. But it&#8217;s also worth noting that Milkah gave Nachor eight children (22:10&#8211;23), while Re&#8217;umah gave him only four. Is there some dynamic going on between Nachor and Milkah that is being passed through to the grandchildren, making them particularly concerned with their status and property (perhaps because that&#8217;s all Milkah is getting from Nachor)?</p> <p>At any rate, you don&#8217;t have to be Stuart Smalley to think that Rebecca is coming from a somewhat dysfunctional family. She certainly doesn&#8217;t waste any time getting away from it.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>In Genesis 25:6, it says, &#8220;to the sons of Abraham&#8217;s concubines, he gave gifts.&#8221; My wife pointed out a Rashi on this verse, saying that these gifts were <i>shem tum&#8217;ah</i>, &#8220;impure names&#8221; that could be used for sorcery. Gur Aryeh (cited in the ever-helpful Reb Footnote) explains where the rabbis got this idea: since the previous verse reported that Abraham gave Isaac everything he owned, the concubines could not have received any <em>physical</em> gifts from Abraham. <p>The Gur Aryeh sounds very much like those people who say that you&#8217;re not really stealing from musicians when you download MP3s off the Internet, since nobody is being deprived of any physical property. I suppose that in Abraham&#8217;s time, they did not have a concept of &#8220;intellectual property.&#8221; Or if they did, it didn&#8217;t apply to kabbalistic formulas.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Michael Freund <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1068525558322">proposes</a> that the Israeli Foreign Ministry pressure European governments to return Jewish land that was seized, not just by the Nazis and Soviets, but by medieval European governments. <p>Eugene Volokh <a href="http://volokh.com/#106869712679531813">objects</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The principles that bona fide purchasers can&#8217;t get rightful possession of stolen property, and that corporate bodies may have obligations that persist over long times, are sound over the short-term, but they become less and less just over the long-term.</p> </blockquote> <p>From a strict libertarian point of view, such claims become <em>more</em> just over the long term, not less just. If I steal a bushel of seeds from some farmers, and it takes a whole year for them to recover their property, I have not just deprived them of the seeds, but of the produce that they would have grown from the seeds. Thus, quite appropriately, when a court convicts someone of a tort, the defendant must pay back the plaintiff with interest. Furthermore, everyone agrees that if the victim of a tort does not live to collect on his or her claim, the victim&#8217;s heirs have the moral right to prosecute the case. Someone who really believes that property rights are a supreme value should be very, very concerned about how to settle 500-year-old stolen-property claims.</p> <p>I&#8217;m not a strict libertarian (and, to be fair, neither is Prof.&nbsp;Volokh), so I don&#8217;t particularly care about recovering the assets that were looted from my great-great-great-grandparents. However, if the Anarcho-Libertarian Revolution sweeps the world and various disposessed groups start lining up at the courts, I can propose a simple way to satisfy them.</p> <p>Simply invite everyone to join a Stale Property Claim Mutual Insurance Fund. The fund would estimate how much property each member would owe to other members to compensate for past historical wrongs, and how much others would owe to that person. Depending on which number was greater, the fund would send the member a bill or a check for the difference. The fund would also use the combined premiums of its members to sue non-members who appeared to be sitting on ill-gotten ancestral gains, and to defend any member from similar suits by non-members.</p> <p>Of course, the more money you have, the more likely it is for <em>some</em> of it to be tainted by a previous theft. And no matter what ethnic group you belong to, there was probably <em>some</em> period of history in which your ancestors were rich and then some invading hooligans made them poor. So, in practice, a fund like this would be taking money from the rich and giving it to the poor.</p> <p>Hey, maybe I should become a strict libertarian, after all. I mean, I&#8217;m very much in favor of private property. I think <em>every</em>body should have some.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<blockquote> <p>And Sarai, Abram&#8217;s wife, had not had a child by him, and she had an Egyptian maid named Hagar. And Sarai said to Avram, &#8220;Behold, the Eternal has held me back from childbirth. Please, go to my maidservant; perhaps I will be built up through her.&#8221;</p> <p>And Abram said to Sarai, &#8220;Behold, babe, the Guy Upstairs told me, in the last chapter, that I would have children. If I don&#8217;t sleep with anyone but you, then the only way He can fulfill His own prophecy is by letting me make you pregnant! So stick with me, honey, and let Hagar find her own damn husband.&#8221;</p> </blockquote> <p>Why <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> the story go that way?</p> <p>In the previous chapter, along with God&#8217;s promise that Abram would have children, there is a warning (Genesis 15:13): &#8220;your offspring will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, and [the natives there] will make them work and suffer for four hundred years.&#8221; So perhaps, when Sarai made her offer, Abram thought: <i>Hmm. If my heir is the son of an Egyptian woman, when my descendents have to become &#8220;strangers in a land not theirs,&#8221; they&#8217;ll be going somewhere</i> other than <i>Egypt. And Egypt, as I saw when I visted there a few chapters ago, is no place for a nice monotheist; they&#8217;re as rich as Sodom and Gomorrah, and just as corrupt, too. I know that if I stick with Sarai, she&#8217;ll eventually get pregnant, but taking Hagar would spare my descendants a lot of grief.</i></p> <p>Too bad it didn&#8217;t work out like that, eh?</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>One striking thing about the Tower of Babel story (Genesis 11:1&#8211;9) is the absence of names. In between the geneology of the ancestors of the &#8220;seventy nations of the world&#8221; (10:1&#8211;32) and the line from Shem to Avram (11:10&#8211;32), there is a story in which &#8220;a man said to his fellow, &#8216;let us make bricks&#8230;&#8217; And they said, &#8216;Let us build a city and a tower &#8230; and make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered all over the earth&#8217;&#8221; (11:3&#8211;4). Why doesn&#8217;t the text identify who invented the brick, or who <em>first</em> proposed building the city and tower? <p>Today, when political theorists model how people act in society, it is popular to treat every behavior, even behavior that seems altruistic and civic-minded, as an person&#8217;s attempt to advance his or her individual self-interest. (The truly <i>au courant</i>, of course, talk about <em>genes</em> promoting their own self-interest.) Two and three hundred years ago, philosophers were more sophisticated. Having seen the brutal wars between Catholics and Protestants in Europe, they understood, among other things, the human capacity for <em>selfless cruelty</em>. People do horrible things in the name of Great Causes that they would never imagine doing for their personal benefit.</p> <p>The anonymous masses wanted to &#8220;make a name for ourselves &#8230; lest we be scattered all over the earth.&#8221; But we know, from the previous chapter, that God intended for the children of Noah to spread all over the earth. The tower-builders had tied their egos to the success of a project that was destined to fail. The only question was, how was it going to fail?</p> <p>It seems to me that when God said &#8220;now nothing will prevent them from doing what they plan to do&#8221; (11:6), He means that nothing would prevent them from doing what they wanted <em>to each other</em>. If one person had broken away from the group and said &#8220;I don&#8217;t think this tower is such a good idea after all&#8221; or even &#8220;hey, the mortar down here is crumbling, we need to come up with a better formulation,&#8221; the energy that the community had focused on building the tower would be refocused on punishing the dissenter. They would tell each other that no torture could be too cruel for the fiend who had <em>insulted their city and tower</em>.</p> <p>To prevent this from happening, God destroyed the group&#8217;s unity of purpose. As Rabbi Yehuda Henkin points out in <cite>Equality Lost</cite>, the Tower of Babel story uses the word <i>safah</i>, which is usually translated as &#8220;language,&#8221; but can also be translated as &#8220;opinion.&#8221; By reintroducing diversity of opinion into the community, God prevented any one person from becoming a scapegoat for the tower&#8217;s failure. (Perhaps everyone still wanted to build the tower, but nobody could agree on how to continue the project.)</p> <p>If the people had considered the tower to be one man&#8217;s idea, then God could have convinced that man to lead the community in a new direction, or punished him in a way that diminished his authority. But as long as everyone else considered it &#8220;our tower,&#8221; they would have simply raised up a new leader. However the tower-building enterprise got started, since no single person was responsible for maintaining it, no single person deserves to be mentioned by name in the story.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Rashi&#8217;s commentary on the Chumash begins with a very odd dialogue. <blockquote> <p>Rabbi Yitzchak said: The Torah didn&#8217;t have to begin with anything but &#8220;This month shall be for you&#8230;&#8221; [the commandment for Rosh Chodesh, over in Exodus], because that was the first commandment that Israel was bound by. Why does it open with <i>bereshit</i>?&#8230; Because if the nations of the world say to Israel, &#8220;You are thieves, because you conquered the lands of the seven nations,&#8221; [Israel] would say to them, &#8220;All the world belongs to the Blessed Holy One. He created it and gave it to whoever is worthy in His eyes. By His free will he gave it to them [the seven nations], and by His free will he took it from them and gave it to us.&#8221;</p> </blockquote> <p>What is the point of this conversation? It can&#8217;t be an argument over our moral claim to the Land of Israel. First, Rabbi Yitzchak couldn&#8217;t have expected the other nations to say, &#8220;well, if <em>their</em> holy book says that God gave them the land, it&#8217;s OK for them to have it.&#8221; (In our own day, that kind of argument hasn&#8217;t persuaded many Arabs, has it?) Second, as Rabbi Yeshiahu Leibowitz ztz&#8221;l pointed out, if we accept that God took the land from the Caananites and gave it to us, we also have to accept that He took it from us and gave it to the Romans, and so on &#8230; so we have no moral claim against other nations that are currently occupying parts of the land.</p> <p>However, if we look at Rabbi Yitzchak&#8217;s dialogue in the context of the Roman occupation of Israel, I think we can find a better interpretation for it. These &#8220;nations of the world&#8221; are not talking about our <em>land</em>, but about our <em>character</em>.</p> <p>They are saying: &#8220;Why are you making such a fuss about how the Romans took your land from you, destroyed your Temple, and killed so many of your people? Your ancestors took the same land from the Canaanites, destroyed their temples, and killed many of their people. If you think the Romans are thieves, your only real complaint is that they are more effective thieves than yourselves.&#8221;</p> <p>We cannot refute such an accusation by telling other people about our laws. We <em>can</em>, however, refute it by telling our <em>stories</em>&#8212;the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves, which do more to shape our attitudes than any legal code.</p> <p>The basic psychology of the thief is, &#8220;whatever I can get my hands on, through any means, is mine.&#8221; If our ancestors were a nation of thieves, the heroes of their stories would be powerful warriors and ingenious tricksters. But the Torah has no such heroes. Avram played a decisive role in a war among Canaanite city-states, but when the king of Sodom offered him a share of the loot, he refused (Genesis 14:22). Jacob, with his stratagems against Esau and Lavan, is the closest thing the Chumash has to a trickster figure, but his life story is one tragedy after another. Instead of warriors and tricksters, we tell stories of one God, who has given free will to human beings, but who, from the first moment of creation, demonstrates absolute control over the physical universe.</p> <p>This line of argument only holds, of course, if the stories in the Chumash <em>do</em> shape our attitudes. If the biblical narrative shows characters striving for one moral standard, but our behavior in everyday life shows us striving for a completely different one, we can no longer take advantage of R.&nbsp;Yitzchak&#8217;s argument. If we praise the same kinds of rogues that our enemies praise, the only difference being the targets of their crimes, then we shouldn&#8217;t wait for the nations of the world to accuse us of anything. We should ask ourselves: why <em>are</em> we mourning for the land that a more effective thief captured from us?</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Marshall Brain is <a title="free registration required" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-brain15oct15,1,7873837.story?coll=la-news-comment-opinions">planning ahead</a> for an age when robots do all the work and human beings become unemployable. When Mr.&nbsp;Brain and other pundits make predictions of this ilk, they forget that no robot, however advanced, is a match for the power of the Federal Reserve Bank. <p>Suppose that someone invents a robotic fast-food worker that can replace a worker at McDonald&#8217;s. If I own a McDonald&#8217;s franchise, I can choose to buy (or lease) the robot, or I can continue to hire human beings for the same job. If the robot is so cheap that no human would work for a competitive price, then all of my employees will be laid off. If workers in a wide range of industries are competing with similar robots, then we will see massive unemployment. Many workers who remain employed will see their wages drop, so that they can remain cheaper than the robots.</p> <p>But this is where the Federal Reserve exercises its awesome power, <em>the power to print money</em>. What happens if more money is circulated through the economy? From a worker&#8217;s point of view, the inflationary effect of the increased money supply counteracts the deflationary effect of the robots. From a business owner&#8217;s point of view, inflation eats away the value of capital investments&#8212;including robots. Under those circumstances, someone opening a new McDonald&#8217;s, or looking to replace a broken fast-food robot, will be better off hiring a human being at inflated wages than hoping that a robot&#8217;s output will make up for the purchase price plus inflation. There&#8217;s no way the robot-makers can invent more productive robots faster than the Fed can crank out money.</p> <p>If for some reason the Fed <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> exercise its power, we&#8217;ll have Depression-scale deflation, few people will be able to afford the products that the robots crank out, and once again, the robot owners will need to write off most of their investments.</p> <p>As human workers look to specialize in whatever kind of work robots can&#8217;t do cheaply enough, a lot of people may end up taking massive pay cuts in new careers, or regretting the time they spent learning a skill that&#8217;s been automated away. A humane government, I hope, will do something to reduce the pain of these economic shifts. But until the Terminator takes control of the money supply, there will always be a market for human labor.</p> <p class="via">via <a href="http://www.calpundit.com/archives/002431.html">Calpundit</a></p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>About twenty years ago, I heard Sen.&nbsp;Gary Hart speak to a convention of community organizers. He said he had spoken to someone who was hoping for a scandal, like Watergate, to bring down the Reagan Administration. But, the senator declaimed, when President Reagan cuts spending on education, <em>that</em> is a scandal. And when he cuts such-and-such, <em>that</em> is a scandal. And when he does so-and-so, <em>that</em> is a scandal. (Wild applause from the audience.) <p>A few months later, Hart&#8217;s friend got his <a href="http://www.webcom.com/pinknoiz/covert/icsummary.html">scandal</a>: White House officals had sold arms to Iran and used the money to fund anticommunist insurgents in Nicaragua. And Reagan&#8217;s anointed successor, George H.&nbsp;W. Bush, <em>still</em> got elected.</p> <p>Will the Plame scandal turn out the same way? After all the news stories and op-eds and televised hearings and indictments are over with, will the voters put Republicans back in the White House anyway? I have reason to hope otherwise.</p> <p>Dubya has run for President, and maintained his power as President, by cultivating an aura of invulnerability. During the primaries, he quickly lined up endorsements and donations from the Republican establishment to position himself as his father&#8217;s anointed successor; after McCain won the New Hampshire Republican primary, Bush <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/02/16/carlson/index.html">&#8220;waged one of the roughest primary campaigns in memory&#8221;</a> to prevent the same thing from happening in South Carolina. During the Florida recount battle, while Gore&#8217;s partisans talked about making sure that every vote was counted and letting the recount process determine the victor, the Republicans portrayed Bush as the victor and the Gore/Lieberman team as &#8220;Sore/Loserman.&#8221; After his inauguration, some pundits expected Bush to make a special effort to cooperate with the Democrats in Congress, perhaps triangulating off of Tom DeLay; after all, he had portrayed himself as &#8220;a uniter, not a divider,&#8221; he had lost the popular vote, and the Senate was evenly split. Instead, he convinced Sen.&nbsp;Jim Jeffords to <a href="http://jeffords.senate.gov/~jeffords/press/01/05/05242001party_change.html">quit the Republican Party</a>.</p> <p>The 2002 electron returns and the current tax rates prove how effective this strategy has been. But it has one flaw: you can&#8217;t be <em>mostly</em> invulnerable. Once your opponents &#8212; or, more importantly, your wavering allies &#8212; discover that someone can defy you and live to tell about it, you can no longer keep them in line with a stern tone and a steely glare.</p> <p>The most important sign of Bush&#8217;s infallability, of course, is his failure to uncover stocks of biological and chemical weapons in Iraq, even after declaring &#8220;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/05/01/bush.carrier.landing/">Mission Accomplished</a>.&#8221; Consider what this Administration has faced since then:</p> <ul> <li>They had to eat <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/07/13/cnna.wolf.rice/">sixteen words</a> in the 2003 State of the Union address.</li> <li>The Plame affair grew out of the White-House&#8211;vs.&#8211;CIA finger-pointing over the sixteen words.</li> <li>Bush, who had extracted authorization to use force in Iraq without submitting any budget for the Iraq war, came back to Congress asking for an additional $87 million. The American public <a href="http://stacks.msnbc.com/news/969373.asp?0bl=-0">has not taken the news well.</a></li> <li>The Senate passed the Harkin Amendment, supported by six Republican senators, blocking the Department of Labor&#8217;s new <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/yourjobeconomy/overtimepay/ns09102003.cfm">overtime rules</a>.</li> <li>The House and Senate passed separate resolutions <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/10/14/MNG3P2AS9J1.DTL">blocking</a> new FCC rules, passed in June and endorsed by the President, that make it easier for one corporation to own a large number of TV stations. The outcry against the FCC&#8217;s rule change was joined by a number of prominent Republicans, including <a href="http://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/200306/msg00088.html">William Safire</a>.</li> <li>An <a href="http://data.bls.gov/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet?request_action=wh&graph_name=LN_cpsbref3">unemployment rate</a> that is still higher than it was two years ago, when the recession officially ended.</li> <li>A steady <a href="http://www.pollkatz.homestead.com/files/image001.gif">decline</a> in Bush&#8217;s approval ratings.</li> </ul> <p>When he was President, Reagan faced political challenges that were at least as daunting: e.g., an unemployment rate over 10%, a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, and an Administration where, in Molly Ivins&#8217; words, &#8220;half of it is under average and the other half is under indictment.&#8221; But Reagan was used to political challenges, and even losses. He had run in the 1968 and 1976 Republican Presidential primaries before finally winning the nomination in 1980. He knew how to charm the electorate <em>in spite of</em> his political setbacks.</p> <p>Our current President may have Reagan&#8217;s ideology, but he&#8217;s not Reagan. And while neither Dean nor Clark have Clinton&#8217;s charisma, they&#8217;re not Mondale and Dukakis, either.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Nathan Newman <a href="http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/001239.shtml">argues</a> that when you consider all the unsavory things that the <span class="caps">CIA</span> has done over the past fifty years, progressives shouldn&#8217;t care so much about the Bush Administration leaking the name of a <span class="caps">CIA</span> operative. John Quiggin follows this up by linking to an old <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/economics/johnquiggin/news/Spies0112.html">essay</a> of his. <p>A government, he says, can suppress its domestic opponents quite effectively with <strike>secret police</strike>counterintelligence agencies, but when trying to root out secret information from other countries, it faces a paradox.</p> <blockquote>The basic lesson of game theory for a game of bluff like that of espionage is that, as long as it is possible for counterspies to generate misleading information most of the time, spies are useless even when their information happens to be correct. If the defence plays optimally, the spymaster can never have any reason to believe one piece of information produced by spies and disbelieve another.</blockquote> <p>Quiggin backs up the game theory by citing high-profile intelligence failures from World War II onward.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>If you have committed an offense against someone else, even if you have already paid them whatever monetary damages you owe, you don&#8217;t get forgiveness from Above until you&#8217;ve asked your victim to forgive you. The Mishnah (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 8:7) derives this principle from the story of Abraham and Avimelekh; after Avimelekh has taken Abraham&#8217;s wife for himself (after that whole &#8220;she is my sister&#8221; thing, which we won&#8217;t go into here), God tells Avimelekh (Genesis 20:7), &#8220;now, return the wife of that woman, because he is a prophet, and he will pray for you.&#8221; <p>A commentary on the <i>Shulkhan `Arukh</i> (<i>Me&#8217;irat `Einim, Choshen Mishpat</i> 422:1) takes this argument a step further. You shouldn&#8217;t just get your victim to <em>forgive</em> you &#8212; you should patch up your relationship with your victim to the point where he or she would be willing to <em>pray on your behalf.</em></p> <p>May you all be inscribed and sealed for a happy and prosperous year.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Recently, Americans had to deal with two expensive failures in an infrastructure that millions of people use every day. In one of these failures, the blackout that struck much of the Northeast, the mass media quickly turned from a description of the blackout itself to a discussion of faults in the infrastructure, namely, the power grid. In the other, the one-two-three punch of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/incident/blast.asp">Blaster</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/antivirus/nachi.asp">Welchia</a>, and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/antivirus/sobig.asp">SoBig.F</a>, hardly anyone in the mainstream is discussing the weakness in the corresponding infrastructure, Microsoft Windows, which has helped the worms spread so rapidly. <p>(A welcome exception is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A34978-2003Aug23?language=printer">this Washington Post column</a>, brought to me courtesy <a href="http://www.calpundit.com/archives/001993.html">Kevin Drum</a>, who also demonstrates why experienced Windows users will put off &#8220;critical&#8221; patches to their operating systems as long as they have something better to do with their time, e.g., root-canal work.)</p> <p>Linux and Mac fans, of course, have noticed this media tunnel-vision every time a Windows exploit makes the front pages, all the way back to the <a href="http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/Melissa_FAQ.html">Melissa virus</a>. Every time it happens, we grind our teeth, mutter imprecations against Bill Gates, and wonder when reality will catch up with Microsoft&#8217;s marketing budget. I would suggest, however, that the way we geeks talk about security affects the way <strike>suits</strike>normal people think about security, in a way that discourages them from seeking alternatives to Microsoft.</p> <h1>The wrong metaphor: war</h1> <p>Geeks of every OS religion share a vocabulary of computer security, and most of the terms in that vocabulary have military connotations. Passwords are <i>cracked</i>, and systems are <i>penetrated</i>, by <i>exploits</i>. Hosts on a network that need to be exposed to the public, but don&#8217;t have sensitive information on them, are put in a <i>DMZ</i>. Some operating systems have <i>back doors</i> that bypass whatever security their administrators have set up; in other cases, a program might accept an input that <i>smashes the stack</i>. Crackers find vulnerable dialup lines through <i>war dialing</i> and find vulnerable wireless Internet connections through <i>war driving</i>. Disgruntled employees set <i>logic bombs</i> to take revenge on their managers. A file that was advertised as a Britney Spears picture turns out to be a <i>Trojan horse</i>. You get the idea.</p> <p>People who are familiar with computer security understand where the dramatic metaphor ends and where prosaic reality begins. If I have a physical firewall around my computer, and someone lights a physical fire outside of it, the safety of my computer depends on the resources of the arsonist: with the right chemicals, any firewall can be turned to rubble. If I have an electronic &#8220;firewall&#8221; between my computer and the public Internet, and the firewall is configured to block all incoming traffic, the world&#8217;s most brilliant network engineers with the world&#8217;s most powerful computers will not be able to override the firewall <em>simply</em> by sending packets to it over the Internet.</p> <p>But try to think like someone who doesn&#8217;t know much about computer security, doesn&#8217;t have the time or inclination to learn, and doesn&#8217;t know how to interpret the metaphors. Microsoft is the largest and wealthiest software company in the world, and Windows and Office are their flagship products. Surely, if <em>they</em> are vulnerable to computer viruses, then any comparable products from any competitor <em>must</em> be <em>at least</em> as vulnerable. Any claim that an operating system written by a bunch of volunteers is more secure than Windows doesn&#8217;t deserve a moment&#8217;s serious consideration &#8212; you might as well say that instead of using the United States Army to restore order to Iraq, we&#8217;d be better off sending in a few high-school marching bands.</p> <h1>The other wrong metaphor: disease</h1> <p>When people talk about computer <i>worms</i> and <i>viruses</i>, or say their server is <i>infected</i>, they are of course using a biological metaphor instead of a military one. Many geeks also assert that the Windows &#8220;monoculture&#8221; in the computer world makes it easier for worms to propagate. But they, too, are confusing the metaphor with the facts.</p> <p><em>Why</em> is biodiversity such a good defense against biological pathogens? Beyond a certain point, you can be too effective at defending yourself against bacteria &#8212; so effective that you starve to death, or suffer allergic reactions to all the available food, instead of eating something that might infect you. Every organism has to trade off a need to protect itself against infection with a need to eat, and breathe, and otherwise interact with a disease-filled world. For a species whose reproductive cycle is a few thousand times slower than a bacterium&#8217;s, part of that trade-off involves making your body chemistry as distinct as possible from your neighbors, to minimize the chance that a bug that infected your neighbors will be able to infect you. By the same token, a pathogen that can infect a wide range of hosts is paying a metabolic cost for its ability, and risks losing the evolutionary competition to a strain that can attack a smaller range of hosts with a lower energy expenditure.</p> <p>Thus, in nature, we see pathogens that specialize and hosts that individualize. Diseases that cross from one species to another are the exception rather than the rule, and even for an extremely virulent disease (e.g., smallpox and Ebola), some hosts in the target species are naturally immune.</p> <p>But these budget constraints, so to speak, do not apply to computers or computer &#8220;viruses&#8221;. They are artifacts constrained by human desire and skill, not organisms constrained by natural selection. A computer needs electricity to run, not a fresh supply of executable software from sources that its owners cannot trust. If the authors of SoBig.F had designed it to attack Linux as well as Windows systems, the worm would have taken up a few more kilobytes of hard-disk space and taken a few more milliseconds to travel from one host to another, but this burden would not have saved a single Windows machine from infection.</p> <h1>The right metaphor: con job</h1> <p>This is how to explain computer security to the general public:</p> <p>Disguise, not force, is the essence of the confidence game. A criminal masquerades as a bank examiner, or a roll of dollar bills is switched with a stack of worthless paper. Likewise, in order to subvert a computer system without physically touching it, the attacker must impersonate privileges that he or she does not legitimately have.</p> <p>Money and power can insulate a person or corporation against physical attacks, but not against cons. Consider, for example, the <a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/5100-6255-5034037.html">phoner toner</a> scam: an office worker buys &#8220;discount&#8221; printer toner from someone who pretends to be the company&#8217;s regular supplier, and receives a case of poor-quality toner and an overinflated bill. The owner of a small company with low turnover can give all of its employees corporate credit cards, tell everyone to be careful, and trust that losses to this kind of scam will be rare and controllable. The directors of a large company can limit which employees have the power to spend the company&#8217;s money and impose rules on how it may be spent (for example, by only allowing them to get office supplies from authorized vendors). But a large company that <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> impose such controls is going to leak money &#8212; from &#8220;phoner toner&#8221; and similar scams, from employees who are careless about spending their employer&#8217;s funds, a<br />
nd from deliberate fraud by insiders.</p> <p>Imagine a company that starts out by treating its assets as a pool from which every worker can draw, grows into a huge firm without changing this attitude, and suffers humiliating losses from one crook after another. The directors add financial controls, but employees, even the honest ones, bitterly resist them. Why? Over the years, cliques within the firm have developed informal systems for sharing and exchanging resources. These systems have served the company and its customers well, but they are incompatible with the new regime. To avoid outright revolt, the directors quickly scale back their plans, trying to minimize the imposition on their employees, and institute piecemeal reforms. But because of the company&#8217;s great wealth, the number of employes with positions of financial responsibility, and its reputation as an easy mark, other criminals continue to probe the weaknesses in the system, and the losses continue.</p> <p>That company is a metaphor for Microsoft Windows. Since its pre-Internet days, Windows has been designed to make it easy for programs to share information. If you&#8217;re a programmer who writes applications for Windows, or who is adding features to the operating system itself, this is very convenient. If, however, you&#8217;re trying to secure a Windows machine, or fix a Windows security hole <em>without breaking something else</em>, the reverse is true.</p> <p>For example, after installing the recent patches to shield themselves from the Blaster worm, some users <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&threadm=03a101c3635b%24079cb4b0%24a101280a%40phx.gbl&rnum=2&prev=/groups%3Fq%3Dblaster%2Bexchange%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26ie%3DUTF-8%26selm%3D03a101c3635b%2524079cb4b0%2524a101280a%2540phx.gbl%26rnum%3D2">report</a> that they can no longer connect to remote Microsoft Exchange email servers. By contrast, your humble author found out about <a href="http://www.openssh.com/txt/buffer.adv">an SSH security hole</a> while composing this message, and upgraded the machine that serves this Web page without even breaking his laptop&#8217;s connection to it.</p> <p>Even with the best tools, it is hard to write robust software, and Microsoft&#8217;s popularity makes it an especially attractive target for vandals. But these two facts are not enough to explain the high cost of Windows security holes. This cost is a by-product of the <em>design</em> of Microsoft Windows, and until Microsoft&#8217;s customers demand some fundamental changes in that design, they will continue to pay that cost.</p> <h1>Not just Microsoft</h1> <p>Before open-source fans get <em>too</em> smug, I should remind them that <a href="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-15.html">BIND</a> and <a href="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-12.html">sendmail</a>, two venerable open-source packages, have long been <a href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/blurb/unbind.html">poster</a> <a href="http://cr.yp.to/maildisasters/sendmail.html">children</a> for bad security. Judging from what others have written about them, they suffer from the same design weaknesses as Windows, on a smaller scale. Fortunately, for both of these packages, there are a variety of competing open-source packages that provide almost all the same functionality.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>In the course of <a href="http://ou.org/torah/ti/5763/reeh63.htm">an otherwise interesting commentary</a> on last week&#8217;s parsha, Rabbi&nbsp;Avraham Fischer says: <blockquote>[Someone who feels very distant from God] must continue to pursue Hashem, to revere Him from the position of beholding the &#8220;mysterium tremendun&#8221; [sic] and to obey His commands.</blockquote> <p>Reading this, I wondered: why, in the course of a <i>d&#8217;var Torah</i> written for an Orthodox Jewish audience, does this rabbi use the language of the Roman Catholic Church?</p> <p>As far as I can tell from Google, &#8220;mysterium tremendum&#8221; was first used by Rudolph Otto, in his book <cite>The Idea of the Holy</cite> (1923), referring to God as a Wholly Other Being who inspires a numinous dread. The phrase also appears in an oft-quoted sentence from Martin Buber: &#8220;God is the mysterium tremendum that appears and overthrows, but he is also the mystery of the self-evident, nearer to me than my I.&#8221;</p> <p>OK, so I think I understand what he means now, and it&#8217;s not like &#8220;mysterium tremendum&#8221; is some term that the Vatican came up with that refers to the Trinity. But I am still left with two questions:</p> <ol> <li>Why should a person in this situation regard God specifically as the &#8220;mysterium tremendum?&#8221; Why not, say, the mystery of the self-evident? This issue probably deserves a page in and of itself, but instead the matter is just referred to in passing in the next-to-last paragraph of the drash.</li> <li>Why can&#8217;t R.&nbsp;Fischer just say what he means in plain Yiddish?</li> </ol></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>In September 2000, <cite>The Jewish Homemaker</cite>, a magazine published by Organized Kashrus Laboratories, published <a href="http://www.ok.org/homemaker/tishrei61/person.html">In Defense of Dr.&nbsp;Laura</a>, an essay praising the talk-show host and describing her journey to an Orthodox Jewish conversion. <p>According to the article, Rabbi&nbsp;Reuven Bulka, of Ottawa, shepherded her through the conversion process. When her speech before a secular Jewish group got a frosty reception, Rabbi&nbsp;Bulka &#8220;was on the phone every afternoon, trying to talk me through this. He told me, &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to go down in history as the rabbi who lost Dr. Laura!&#8217;&#8221;</p> <p>Well, I hope the good rabbi can find some other way to make his mark in history. According to the <a href="http://www.forward.com/issues/2003/03.08.15/news2.html">Forward</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>In a shocking if little-noticed revelation, Schlessinger &#8212; who very publicly converted to Judaism five years ago &#8212; opened &#8220;The Dr. Laura Schlessinger Program&#8221; on August 5 with the confession that she will no longer practice Judaism. Although Schlessinger said she still &#8220;considers&#8221; herself Jewish, &#8220;My identifying with this entity and my fulfilling the rituals, etc., of the entity &#8212; that has ended.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>Schlessinger began her August 5 program by noting that, prior to each broadcast, she spends an hour reading faxes from fans and listeners. &#8220;By and large the faxes from Christians have been very loving, very supportive,&#8221; she said. &#8220;From my own religion, I have either gotten nothing, which is 99% of it, or two of the nastiest letters I have gotten in a long time. I guess that&#8217;s my point &#8212; I don&#8217;t get much back. Not much warmth coming back.&#8221;</p> <p>Schlessinger even hinted at a possible turn to Christianity &#8212; a move that, radio insiders say, would elevate her career far beyond the 300 stations that currently syndicate her show. &#8220;I have envied all my Christian friends who really, universally, deeply feel loved by God,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They use the name Jesus when they refer to God&#8230; that was a mystery, being connected to God.&#8221;</p> <p>In her 25 years on radio, Schlessinger said she was moved &#8220;time and time again&#8221; by listeners who wrote and described that they had &#8220;joined a church, felt loved by God and that was my anchor.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>Of her conversion to Judaism, Schlessinger said, &#8220;I felt that I was putting out a tremendous amount toward that mission, that end, and not feeling return, not feeling connected, not feeling that inspired. Trust me, I&#8217;ve talked to rabbis, I&#8217;ve read, I&#8217;ve prayed, I&#8217;ve agonized and I came to this place anyway &#8212; which is not exactly back to the beginning, but more in that direction than not.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>In 2001, despite the controversy surrounding her, the National Council of Young Israel honored Schlessinger for her &#8220;traditional American values.&#8221; Rabbi Pesach Lerner, the executive director of Young Israel, was surprised by Schlessinger&#8217;s defection but declined to comment on it.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the <cite>Jewish Homemaker</cite> article, the remark that got Schlessinger into trouble was &#8220;the benign observation that the only thing missing from a fund-raising video about the group was the fact that giving charity is a mitzvah. In her words, &#8216;It doesn&#8217;t matter if you feel&#8217; like giving; tzeddakah is mandatory.&#8221; Now, however, Schlessinger has discovered that she doesn&#8217;t feel like following Jewish rituals, so she won&#8217;t do it any more.</p> <p>I thought that if you&#8217;re an Orthodox Jew, you call yourself a Jew and you observe the <i>mitzvot</i> because you are fulfilling commandments that were given to you by the Powerful, Great, Mighty, and Awesome God, who took you out of the Land of Egypt to serve Him. Apparently, Schlessinger thought she was signing on to a different kind of Orthodox Judaism, one in which you&#8217;re &#8220;identifying with this entity&#8221; and as &#8220;fulfilling the rituals, etc., of the entity&#8221; as long as the rest of the Jewish community pats you on the head, or as long as you are &#8220;feeling connected&#8221; and &#8220;feeling inspired.&#8221;</p> <p>Her conversion was (as far as I know) halakhically valid, and I shouldn&#8217;t rejoice in any Jew&#8217;s announcement that he or she is no longer performing a <i>mitzvah</i>, so I can&#8217;t say &#8220;good riddance.&#8221; But &#8230; sheesh! Can someone find this lady a therapist, a <em>real</em> one?</p> <p>By the way, I would be interested in hearing Schlessinger, or the rabbis who praised her, explain why Jewish ethics permit someone with a doctorate in <em>physiology</em> to call herself &#8220;Doctor&#8221; on a radio show in which she dispenses psychological advice. Aren&#8217;t there issues of <i>geneivat da&#8217;at</i> here?</p> <p class="via">via <a href="http://maxspeak.org/gm/archives/00001383.html">MaxSpeak</a></p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Jose Hernandez-Rebollar, of George Washington University, has developed a glove that can translate the manual alphabet, and some signs in <abbr title="American Sign Language">ASL</abbr>, into spoken English. He expects a two-handed version to be ready by 2005. <p>The <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/08/03/talking.glove.ap/">AP article</a> mentions the military applications of similar devices, but highlights the glove&#8217;s potential as a machine for helping the deaf. How stupid is this idea? Let me count the ways:</p> <ol> <li>According to the article, &#8220;the device usually is accurate, though the precision declines with complicated movements; for example, words that start with the same hand movement or orientation.&#8221; If the machine can&#8217;t reach this level of accuracy, I doubt it can handle the modulation that distinguishes &#8220;is red,&#8221; &#8220;is very red,&#8221; and &#8220;becomes red.&#8221; And how well is it going to resolve &#8212; let alone translate &#8212; ASL <a href="http://seattlecentral.edu/faculty/sbarber/asl101/Resources/ASL%20Classifiers.htm">classifiers</a>?</li> <li>ASL is not just made with the two hands, but with the face and, to a lesser extent, the upper body. A motion of the eyebrows and a tilt of the head, combined with a modulation of the hand movement, distinguishes &#8220;Should I help you?&#8221; and &#8220;Regarding my helping you&#8230;&#8221; from &#8220;I help you.&#8221; Benjamin Behan wrote a 1996 dissertation on how ASL can mark subject-verb agreement with facial expression <em>alone</em>. A complete translation system, therefore, is going to require more than just two gloves.</li> <li>Even if someone had the hardware to pick up all the linguistically relevant parts of ASL, the software would still have to translate from ASL to English. This is much harder than typing German text into a Web form and getting something resembling English text from the Babelfish server; it&#8217;s more like speaking Navajo into a microphone and getting English out of the computer&#8217;s speaker.</li> <li>Of course, if you stop describing this machine&#8217;s input as &#8220;American Sign Language,&#8221; you could have a machine that understands a <a href="http://www.seecenter.org/brochure.htm">manually</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0913580813/accentoninter-20/102-5453035-1356934">coded</a> English system, and translates the words it picks up to spoken or written English. But what deaf person would use it to communicate with hearing people, when they could just as well use <em>a pencil and paper?</em></li> </ol> <p>The article quotes Andy Lange, president of the National Association of the Deaf: &#8220;Some feel that being deaf is not a deficiency. It&#8217;s simply another way of life and the deaf should not use artificial means to overcome a loss of hearing.&#8221; I realize that people in Mr.&nbsp;Lange&#8217;s position want to take every opportunity to teach the hearing public about Deaf Culture. However, in this case, such an argument is a distraction.</p> <p>At most, a &#8220;talking sign-language glove&#8221; is a novelty: if they could be mass-marketed for $20 each, they might catch on as toys. But as a tool to help deaf people communicate with the hearing, this is just silly.</p> <p class="via">see also <a href="http://boingboing.net/2003_08_01_archive.html#200443874">Boing Boing</a>, <a href="http://www.amptoons.com/blog/000747.html">Alas, a blog</a>, <a href="http://jwz.livejournal.com/238327.html">jwz</a></p></p>]]>

They don&#8217;t recognize that the political landscape has completely changed since 1985 when the DLC was created and 1992 when it reached its zenith of power. In 2004 it is losing its relevance to many Democrats, not because of a difference in policy but because it has failed to recognize that while they have not changed, the Republican Party has undergone a complete metamorphosis. They do not seem to understand that when the competition completely changes strategy, you must be prepared to change strategy as well.</p> <p>The Republican Party of George W. Bush is fundamentally different than the Party of George H.W. Bush. They are playing a form of political hardball that is completely unresponsive to the cooperative, consensus style politics that characterizes the DLC. They will not budge on policy and when it comes to tactics they are knife wielding thugs.</p> <p>Dean&#8217;s early success isn&#8217;t about liberal spending programs and &#8220;far left&#8221; hatred for Junior. It&#8217;s about opening your eyes and seeing what is right in front of your face &#8212; a dangerously radical Republican party that simply will not compromise or deal fairly.</p> </blockquote></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>To resolve the glut of PhDs who toil in adjunct-faculty jobs while they hope for tenure-track professorships, Daniel Davies <a href="http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/2003_06_29_d-squareddigest_archive.html#105733791393255893">prescribes</a> the bracing tonic of the free market: let the universities sell their professorships for whatever price the market will bear. In defense of this proposal, he appeals to tradition: <blockquote>This isn&#8217;t a piece of hypothetical neoliberal Panglossian market-boosterism, despite appearances, it&#8217;s a very well thought-out proposal to return to a system that has already been thoroughly tested and worked very well. Commissions to be an officer in the British Army used to be bought and sold in the nineteenth century, and so did &#8220;livings&#8221; for parish priests. There was even considerable price discrimination; smarter regiments and more agreeable parishes sold for higher prices. Commissions had to be bought from the regiment, but livings for priests were advertised in the classified columns of the Times.</blockquote> The sale of livings has its counterpart in Jewish history. To quote from Marc Shapiro&#8217;s <cite>Between the Yeshiva World and Modern Orthodoxy: The Life and Works of Rabbi Jehiel Jacob Weinberg, 1884&#8211;1966</cite>: <blockquote>[T]he outright purchase of positions of religious leadership&#8230;is even referred to in the Talmud and its prohibition is recorded in the standard legal codes. Yet despite all the criticism, and a number of <i>herem</i>s promulgated forbidding the sale of rabbinic offices&#8230;it nevertheless remained a common practice and is often referred to in rabbinic literature. In the nineteenth century Rabbi Solomon Judah Rapoport (1790&#8211;1867) referred with pride to the fact that he had broken with the universal practice and refused to shower the community leaders with presents in order to ensure his appointment. By this time the purchase of rabbinic positions had become so prevalent that two leading halakhists, Rabbi Isaac Schmelkes (1828&#8211;1906) and Rabbi Shalom Schwadron (1835&#8211;1911), were led to defend it&#8230;. In the early twentieth century there is at least one example of a rabbi actually advertising in the newspaper for another rabbi, <em>any rabbi,</em> to buy his position from the community.</blockquote> For more comments on Davies&#8217;s proposal, see the <a href="http://www.invisibleadjunct.com/archives/000180.html">Invisible Adjunct</a>; for more details on the nineteenth-century market for English pulpits, see <a href="http://www.freeroller.net/page/jam/20030706">Jam Today</a>.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>David Horowitz doesn&#8217;t have many good things to say about his old comrades in Students for a Democratic Society, but he should acknowledge that Todd Gitlin, who used to be the SDS president, is on to something. <p>Gitlin&#8217;s 1980 book, <a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/1515001.html">The Whole World is Watching</a>, described how mass-media coverage both influenced and isolated the New Left in the 1960s. Reporters and photographers were drawn to the scruffiest and most revolutionary members of the antiwar movement; SDS members, perhaps confusing media coverage with social influence, became progressively more and more inflammatory. By the time a <em>liberal</em> movement against the Vietnam War arose, it was completely separate from the New Left organizations and thinkers who had been opposing the war for years&#8212;because the liberals didn&#8217;t want to be associated with people who threw shit at cops.</p> <p>The New Right of the 2000s, it appears, is now trapped in the same positive-feedback cycle. Case in point: Horowitz&#8217;s <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=8793">review</a> of Ann Coulter&#8217;s latest book, <cite>Treason</cite>.</p> <p>When Coulter, in the wake of 9/11, opined that the US should invade Muslim countries, kill their leaders, and convert them to Christianity, she was booted from the <cite>National Review</cite>, but Horowitz invited her to continue publishing on his own <cite>FrontPage Magazine</cite>. (In the review, Horowitz says he &#8220;regarded Coulter&#8217;s phillipic as a Swiftian commentary on liberal illusions of multi-cultural outreach to people who want to rip out our hearts&#8221;. Uh-huh.) This, and similar sentiments, have won Coulter plenty of TV appearances and book sales.</p> <p>But then Horowitz read <cite>Treason</cite>. He heard Coulter (on <cite>Hardball</cite>) argue that &#8220;the Democratic Party, as an entity, has become functionally treasonable &#8230; [JFK&#8217;s] heart was in the right place but he was surrounded by bad policymakers and he harm[ed] the country and its national security.&#8221; And he realized the Coulter, aside from being full of it, was Bad For The Cause:</p> <blockquote>[T]his charge&#8212;that no Democrat, apparently including Jack Kennedy, can root for America&#8212;is obviously absurd, and if conservatives do not recognize that it is absurd, nobody is going to listen to us.</blockquote> Kevin Drum <a href="http://www.calpundit.com/archives/001593.html">laments</a>: <blockquote>Actually, though, it&#8217;s too bad to see that even conservatives are attacking Coulter since it means she&#8217;ll probably have to tone down her next book. I was looking forward to the third volume in her series in which we learn that Democrats from FDR forward have all been secret child molesters. Now I&#8217;ll never get to read it.</blockquote> <p>Don&#8217;t worry, Kevin&#8212;if the pattern that Gitlin observed holds true, either Coulter will continue to publish more and more outlandish &#8220;Swiftian commentaries&#8221;, or others will compete to outdo her, until the neoconservative movement generates its own versions of the SLA and the Weather Underground.</p> <p>It&#8217;s gonna be one of those decades.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>[Based on a <i>d&#8217;var Torah</i> given by Jennifer Gordon at Kadimah-Toras Moshe Synagogue, at <i>seudah slishit</i>, on June 28, 2003.] <p>In <i>Parshat Shelach</i>, which we read on Saturday, there&#8217;s the story of the arrest and execution of the man who gathered sticks on Shabbat (Numbers 15:32&#8211;36). Immediately after that story, there&#8217;s the commandment of tzitzit (15:37&#8211;41).</p> <p>According to the text, the reason we (Jewish men with four-cornered garments) should wear tzitzit is so that &#8220;you may see them, and remember all the Eternal&#8217;s commandments, and perform them, and not stray after your minds and after your eyes&#8230;.&#8221; The underlying theory seems really cool: people don&#8217;t sin because they&#8217;re <em>wicked</em>, but because they <em>forget</em>. I don&#8217;t gossip about someone because I want to drag his name through the mud (usually), but because I start gabbing, and one thing leads to another, and all of a sudden I&#8217;ve violated the commandments against <i>lashon hara</i>, negative gossip.</p> <p>Two traditional sources discuss why this story and this commandment appear next to each other. The <i>Tanna d&#8217;Bei Eliyahu Rabba</i> (cited by Rabbi Philip Lefkowitz) has a midrash in which God asks Moses why this man was gathering sticks on Shabbat. Moses replied that Jews wear <i>tefillin</i> six days a week, which serves as a reminder to observe the commandments, but have no such reminder on Shabbat, and so God gave tzitzit as another reminder. According to Nachmanides, if that man had been wearing tzitzit, he wouldn&#8217;t have gathered the sticks, because he would have seen the blue thread, which would have reminded him of the sky, which would have reminded him of the Throne of Glory, and he would have refrained from sinning.</p> <p>The problem with both of these explanations is, they&#8217;re absurd:</p> <ol> <li>In order for our stick-gatherer to be liable for the death penalty, two witnesses would have had to see him and explicitly warn him that he was committing a capital crime, and according to the oral tradition (Rashi, quoting Sanhedrin 41a), that&#8217;s exactly what happened. If that warning couldn&#8217;t deter the man, what difference would a little blue thread make?</li> <li>The reason we don&#8217;t wear <i>tefillin</i> on Shabbat is because Shabbat itself is supposed to serve as a sign, so on Shabbat the <i>tefillin</i> are superfluous. If Shabbat isn&#8217;t doing a good enough job at reminding us to observe the commandments, that&#8217;s an argument for wearing <i>tefillin</i> on Shabbat, not an argument for adding another sign.</li> <li>Nachmanides is suggesting a ridiculously long chain of associations for a person to make in the face of temptation.</li> <li>If you&#8217;re wearing one of the standard tzitzit-enhanced garments&#8212;a prayer shawl, a <i>talit katan</i> under your shirt, or one of those square tunics that everybody wore a thousand years ago&#8212;then you usually won&#8217;t even <strong>see</strong> your tzitzit, unless you stare at the ground all the time as you walk around.</li> </ol> <p>All these explanations suggest that tzitzit have some kind of magical power to keep people from sinning. Is there a more rational explanation for how tzitzit can help you lead a more Torah-oriented life?</p> <p>Let me suggest one: you see tzitzit on <em>other people</em> who are wearing them. Tzitzit are only useful in a community of people who wear tzitzit <em>and</em> follow the other commandments. With continual reminders that all of your peers are observant, you feel pressure to do the same, you won&#8217;t follow up on an impulse to look for opportunities to do wrong, and you&#8217;ll be less likely to take advantage of such opportunities when they appear.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>In this week&#8217;s Torah reading, the Israelites complain about not having meat. Then they go on to reminisce about fish, cucumbers, leeks, onions, and garlic (Numbers 11:4&#8211;5). What do they <em>really</em> want here? The passage continues with a description of how the manna was gathered, prepared, and eaten (11:7&#8211;8). Why is that description here, instead of in the chapter where the manna first appeared (Exodus 16)? <p>The Gemara, asking where the &#8220;free&#8221; fish came from, says that when the Israelites drew water, God put small fish in their buckets (Yoma 75a). Let&#8217;s assume, based on this Gemara, that when the Israelites are longing for fish, they&#8217;re longing for <em>small</em> fish, like anchovies. What do small fish, cucumbers, leeks, onions, and garlic have in common?</p> <p>First, <em>they can be prepared easily</em>: you can throw them in a pot of boiling water, and come back in an hour and have stew. Or, if you&#8217;re in a real hurry, you can eat them raw. Second, <em>they can be preserved easily</em>: fish and cucumbers can be pickled, and the other vegetables can just be stashed in a root cellar for months. Manna, on the other hand, <em>took effort to prepare</em>: it had to be ground and then baked (Numbers 11:8). It <em>could not be preserved for even a day</em>: on every day but Friday, leftover manna putrified the following morning (Exodus 16:20), and fresh manna appeared with the morning dew (Numbers 11:9).</p> <p>When you&#8217;re a slave with no time for yourself, and food comes into your hand, the rational thing to do is fill your stomach with as little effort as possible, because the taskmaster might come back at any moment, and store whatever crumbs you don&#8217;t need, because you have no guarantee that more will come tomorrow. The Israelites in the desert had all the time they needed to prepare and enjoy the manna, but some of them had not escaped from the appetite of a slave. To such people, God sent quail, which could be cooked almost as easily as fish. The people who sought the quick gratification of roast poultry found an equally quick death: &#8220;the meat was still between their teeth when they were cut off&#8221; (Numbers 11:33).</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>One of the dirty secrets of the computer-science world is that spreadsheet programs, from Visicalc to Excel, are actually programming languages, even though the program code, input, and output are intermingled and smeared out over two dimensions. And where you have programs, you have <a href="http://www.cs.uml.edu/~hgoodell/EndUser/blend/papers/Margaret_Burnett_et_al.html">bugs</a>: <blockquote>There is a substantial body of research showing that spreadsheets often contain bugs. For example, field audits of real-world spreadsheets have found that 20&#8211;40% of these contain bugs, and that between 1% and 4% of all cells contain bugs. Also, in an early empirical study of experienced spreadsheet users, 44% of the spreadsheets created by those users were found to contain user-generated bugs. Results of several later studies have been similar: between 10% and 90% of the spreadsheets examined have been found to contain bugs. Compounding this problem, creators of spreadsheets seem to express unwarranted confidence in the reliability of their programs. [Citations omitted &#8212;sethg]</blockquote> And where you have bugs, you have <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/67/31298.html">expensive bugs</a>: <blockquote> <p>A simple spreadsheet error cost a firm a whopping US$24m.</p> <p>The mistake led to TransAlta, a big Canadian power generator, buying more US power transmission hedging contracts in May at higher prices than it should have.</p> <p>In a conference call, chief executive Steve Snyder said the snafu was &#8220;literally a cut-and-paste error in an Excel spreadsheet that we did not detect when we did our final sorting and ranking bids prior to submission,&#8221; Reuters reports.</p> </blockquote> <p>If Microsoft, Lotus, and their predecessors had sold spreadsheets as revolutionary new programming languages, they wouldn&#8217;t have had so many customers. Unfortunately, if spreadsheet users <em>don&#8217;t</em> see themselves as programmers, then they have no reason to learn from how programmers in traditional languages protect against bugs, and the companies that make spreadsheets have little incentive to add features that would make spreadsheet-debugging easier.</p> <p>(via the lightweight-languages list)</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Last week&#8217;s Torah reading had the laws regarding the &#8220;nazirite&#8221;, one who swears off wine and haircuts (Numbers 6:1&#8211;21), and the Haftorah was about Samson, the most famous nazirite in the Bible (Judges 13). However, the Torah reading and the Haftorah reading are not really talking about the same kind of person. In the Torah reading, it refers to someone who swears &#8220;a nazirite oath to become a nazirite <em>for the Eternal</em>&#8221; (6:2), and in the Haftorah, an angel tells Samson&#8217;s mother that &#8220;the boy will be a nazirite <em>for God</em> from the womb&#8221; (13:5). The Talmud (Nazir 4b) picks up on the difference in which Divine name is used, and concludes that Samson was not a true nazirite; someone who says &#8220;I swear to be a nazirite like Samson&#8221; is accepting a different set of regulations than someone who says &#8220;I swear to be a nazirite&#8221;. <p>Traditionally, the Tetragrammaton (translated as &#8220;the Eternal&#8221;, or &#8220;the Lord&#8221;) is used to connote God&#8217;s attribute of mercy, while <i>elokim</i> (translated as &#8220;God&#8221;) is used to connote His attribute of justice. As the leader of an Israelite revolt against the Philistines, Samson was a nazirite acting for God in His capacity as Judge. But what does the other kind of nazirite have to do with mercy?</p> <p>Suppose that somebody takes it upon herself, as a spiritual exercise, to fast on Mondays and Thursdays (a traditional form of self-abnegation). A few months later, she realizes that she has a dilemma. On the one hand, she has become so used to going without food for two days a week that fasting is not really a challenge for her any more; the sense of spiritual elevation that she got from fasting has evaporated. On the other hand, the people who know that she fasts still see her as standing apart from the community. If she continues to fast, she will be maintaining this separation to nobody&#8217;s benefit. If she stops fasting, she will touch off a wave of speculation and gossip about her motivations, especially from the people who interpreted her fasting as a form of vanity.</p> <p>A nazirite vow, on the other hand, has an endpoint and a ceremony for marking the endpoint (bringing sacrifices). Just as a nazirite is marked in public by long hair and abstaining from grape products, a person who just completed a nazirite vow is marked by a shaved head. As the ex-nazirite&#8217;s hair grows back to a normal length, he or she can be gradually reintegrated into the community. Since the term of nazirism was specified at the time of the vow (or, if none was specified, thirty days&#8212;Nazir 1:3), the end of the term does not have to be an occasion for any surprise or speculation. This is the mercy shown to the nazirite.</p> <p>Of course, someone can avoid the benefit of this mercy by saying &#8220;I swear to be a nazirite permanently&#8221;; based on II Samuel 14:26 and 15:7, the Talmud deduces that Absalom made such a vow. And since today there is no Temple for bringing sacrifices, if someone makes a nazirite vow, regardless of its term, they won&#8217;t be able to drink wine again until after the Temple is rebuilt. But God can only do so much to protect people from their own foolishness.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Teachers are not overpaid. <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nr_comment/nr_comment061603.asp">Meghan Keane</a>, <a href="http://www.educationnext.org/20033/71.html">Michael Podgursky</a>, and <a href="http://www.educationnext.org/20033/14.html">Richard Vedder</a> say so. How do they know this? Because if you divide teachers&#8217; annual salary by the number of hours they are contractually obliged to work in a year, assuming they spend none of their own time grading papers and none of their own money buying classroom supplies&#8230; <p>(Pause for incredulous laughter from the teachers reading this weblog.)</p> <p>&#8230;then if you compare the average hourly earnings of various professionals working for state and local governments, elementary-school teachers get $30.52, lawyers get $34.64, and engineers, architects, and surveyors get $27.71. &#8220;Solidly Middle Class&#8221;, says the caption on Podgursky&#8217;s bar chart.</p> <p><a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/000833.html">Matthew Yglesias remarks</a>, &#8220;Seems to me that Ms. Keane needs to go back to free market school and remember that there isn&#8217;t some number out there in the sky representing What Teachers Deserve to Get Paid.&#8221; In this vein, I would like to point out <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/ctpmail/PDFs/Turnover-Ing-01-2001.pdf">&#8220;Teacher Turnover, Teacher Shortages, and the Organization of Schools&#8221;</a>, a study by Richard M. Ingersoll of the University of Pennsylvania.</p> <p>Ingersoll points out that while the national employee-turnover rate is 11 percent, the rate for teachers ranges from 13.2&#8211;15 percent, depending on the year of the survey. (Lest you think turnover is high because teaching is a predominantly female profession, the rate for nurses is 12 percent. Lest you think that retirement of elderly teachers is causing the turnover, retirees account for less than 15 percent of it.) In private schools&#8212;those alleged beacons of hope for the union-stifled public education system&#8212;turnover is 18.9 percent. Younger teachers (i.e., those who are just realizing what their job entails) are almost twice as likely to quit their jobs as middle-aged teachers.</p> <p>When teachers were asked why they quit, almost half gave &#8220;poor salary&#8221; as one of the reasons. After accounting for a variety of other teacher and school characteristics, Ingersoll found that the more money a school offered to its experienced teachers, the lower the chance that teachers at that school would leave. This should suprise nobody&#8212;except perhaps Keane, Podgursky, and Vedder. Podgursky opens his article by quoting a former president of the National Education Association &#8212; &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to convince someone to stay in the classroom when the salary is so low&#8221; &#8212; and then tries to convince us that the salary is not so low at all. Don&#8217;t convince us. Convince the teachers who are quitting.</p></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Erin Aubry Kaplan, a black essayist in <a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2003/06/12/nosejobs/index_np.html">Salon</a>, reports with trepidation on a new study: &#8220;Rhinoplasty in the African-American Patient&#8221;. <blockquote>The lead author of the study, Dr. Rod Rohrich, chief of plastic surgery at the University of Texas in Dallas &#8230; sees plastic surgery not as a tool of black assimilation&#8212;that&#8217;s old school&#8212;but as a means of individualization, of sculpting each nose in proportion to each face to achieve what he calls &#8220;nasal-facial harmony&#8221;.</blockquote> Kaplan is unconvinced. As a member of another ethnic group with a reputation for nasal-facial disharmony, I can relate.

<![CDATA[<p>The much-vaunted &#8220;roadmap&#8221; to peace in the Middle East is less than a month old, and judging from <a href="http://www.boston.com/dailynews/164/world/Hamas_Israel_threaten_fight_to%3A.shtml">recent news,</a>, it&#8217;s already headed down the same road as the <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2064026/">Tenet work plan and the Mitchell Report</a>. <p>It&#8217;s easy to get <a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/000778.html#000778">depressed</a> by all this, but only if you start from the assumption that the &#8220;peace process&#8221;, the endless march of summits and agreements and memoranda, has something to do with making peace. At one point, perhaps, it did, but now both sides use it as a tool for something far more important: collecting political favors.</p> <p class="stb">The political leaders of both Israel and the Palestinian Authority have three things in common:</p> <ol> <li>Aid from Western countries makes up a substantial part of their budgets.</li> <li>They have small but militant constituencies who are opposed in principle to any compromise with the other side, and who will tell moderates that any compromise would be suicidal.</li> <li>Most of their constituents would support a two-state solution in theory, but are easily spooked by the militants&#8217; threats of doom. At the same time, they do not want to lose the benefits that flow from Western aid.</li> </ol> <p>The logical way for Sharon and Abbas to respond to these pressures is to make as few concessions as their foreign patrons can possibly tolerate, while announcing their peaceful aspirations as loudly as they can. The logical way for the militants to respond is to make the most trouble at the times when Israeli-Palestinian cooperation seems most likely.</p> <p>Palestinian Authority leaders can credibly tell their foreign patrons that they would just love to put Palestinian terrorist organizations out of action, but ever since Israel decimated the PA security organizations, they have been unable to do so. Since Israel cannot make the corresponding excuse for, say, not restricting the growth of settlements in the West Bank, they enter the diplomatic &#8220;peace process&#8221; game at a disadvantage. Furthermore, in the current round of play, the PA has replaced Arafat, a change that Sharon has been advocating for years, and the US has eliminated Saddam Hussein, one of Israel&#8217;s chief strategic threats. Even if these changes do nothing to help Israel&#8212;even if terrorists kill just as many Israelis as before&#8212;the rest of the world is not going to put any serious pressure on the PA until Israel makes more concessions.</p> <p class="stb">Sharon can do one thing to improve Israel&#8217;s diplomatic position. He can demand that if Palestinian militant organizations do not follow an order from the PA to stand down, and if the PA does not prevent them from continuing to attack Israelis, then in future negotiations, the militants should have seats at the table alongside the PA, and no agreement with the PA will be signed unless the militants agree to endorse it.</p> <p>Such a policy would have a number of benefits for Israel.</p> <ul> <li>If the PA does have the means to neutralize the militant groups, this demand gives them the strongest possible incentive to do so, because its legitimacy as a proto-government is at stake.</li> <li>If the militants do get seats at the table, and say nothing but &#8220;no&#8221;, then they will be able to veto progress in peace talks without killing a single Israeli, while pressure on Israel to make concessions will be substantially reduced.</li> <li>If the militants all agree to de-escalate the violence, and terrorism continues unabated, there will be nobody left to shift the blame to.</li> </ul> <p>Unfortunately, this policy would also break a long-standing tradition in Israeli-Palestinian relations: Israel&#8217;s quest to choose Palestinian leaders. During the 1970s, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin received covert Israeli support for the Islamic charities he ran; the Israeli government wanted to encourage Islamic radicalism among the Palestinians as a way of undermining the secular PLO. In 1988, Yassin became a founding leader of Hamas, and now the Israeli government considers him a legitimate military target. During the first <i>intifada</i>, the home-grown Palestinian leaders in the West Bank and Gaza were more militant than the PLO bureaucrats, including Arafat, in Tunisia; Rabin no doubt considered this fact when he signed the Oslo accords and brought Arafat back to Ramallah.</p> <p>Without a radical change of tactics on the Israeli side, Abbas will prove just as much of a disappointment. Israeli diplomats and politicians will grumble about how, if only someone else were running the PA, Israel would have a true partner for peace, this time for sure. And yet the &#8220;peace process&#8221; will continue: the Oslo accord and the Wye River agreement and the Mitchell report and the Tenet work plan and the Quartet road map will be followed by&#8230;wait a minute while I check my thesaurus&#8230;</p></p>]]>
