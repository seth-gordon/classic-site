    <h1>Knives [excerpt]<br>
      <span style="font-size: smaller;">by Seth Gordon</span></h1>
    <p>
      According to my memory, from my earliest childhood through
      Sunday night, English was one language.  On Monday morning, my
      first day of high school, there was boytalk and girltalk.  I
      didn’t realize girltalk existed until my friend Mimi Rosenberg
      started speaking it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw Mimi at the doorway to room 106, the homeroom across from
      mine.  She had her left arm around another Asian girl, shorter
      and thinner, with a scar along her left cheek.  With her right
      arm extended in front of her, Mimi took their picture with a
      cell phone.  After the flash went off, she waved me closer.  The
      phone buckled in her grip, like a thin black sponge, as she
      stuffed it in her pocket.  She wore a Bowie knife in a leather
      holster against her jeans.
    </p>
    <p>
      (The knife business started Sunday night.  After I cut my hand,
      I noticed that my mother had a <i>kaiken</i> dagger strapped to
      the waist of her skirt: the scabbard and hilt combined to make a
      rectangle of white lacquer that I recognized from samurai
      movies.)
    </p>
    <p>
      “Troy!” she squealed.  “Penelope Ito, here, just moved in from
      London.  Penelope, Troy Yamamoto, who just spent a month in
      Japan.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelope nodded at me, rustling hair that went way down her
      back.  A hilt the color of rope was tucked into her navy-blue
      dress.  The scar traced a thin curve from her cheek to the hinge
      of her jaw.  “Hi,” she said.  Then she asked Mimi, “Do you go
      out with him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” Mimi laughed, “we just grittick.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We what?” I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s just a girltalk word.”  Mimi let go of Penelope’s
      shoulders and made a dismissive gesture, but her self-confidence
      seemed to waver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mimi and I had been friends since kindergarten, and I told
      anyone rude enough to ask (my little sister, for example) that I
      liked my classmate, but Not That Way.  I assumed she felt the
      same way about me, but I wondered why she would talk about it in
      code.
    </p>
    <p>
      “At age three,” Penelope said, “I played this game with my dad,
      where he pretended to understand girltalk.  I would say ‘I
      veschang want a biscuit, Daddy!’ and he’d say ‘I papapopo have a
      biscuit, Penny!’ and we both just cracked up.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I went over the words <i>grittick</i> and <i>veschang</i> in my
      head, so I could remember to look them up later; in Japan I had
      gotten used to picking up new vocabulary without pestering my
      new friends, <i>what does that mean? what does that mean?</i>
      Then I noticed the silence and realized that the girls were
      waiting for me to say something.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How do you like America?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelope looked around the hallway: glazed yellow brick walls,
      flourescent lights, room numbers hand-painted in black next to
      each doorway.  I noticed a symbol like a hieroglyph under each
      room number: below 106 was a giant eye, the pupil looking up and
      to my left, while 105, my homeroom across the hall, had a
      sketched figure on horseback, arms upraised.  Each symbol was
      framed by the mortar of a single brick.
    </p>
    <p>
      “America suits me,” Penelope said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked the least banal question I could come up with, and the
      one that was most on my mind.  “What happened to your face?”  I
      touched my own cheek with my right hand; feeling self-conscious
      about my own scar, I pressed my left knuckles into my thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I fought,” she said.  “In my old school.”  She looked at the
      floor, and even before Mimi gave me one of her sour looks,
      I knew I had said the wrong thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I could apologize or think of anything else to say,
      Mimi put a hand on the small of Penelope’s back.  “Come on,”
      she said.  “I can subcline for you after we sit down.”  That was
      girltalk, as of Monday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could only retreat to my own homeroom.  While I waited for the
      bell to ring, I picked a square of red paper out of my backpack
      and started folding.  The origami book Haruka had given me in
      Japan had a design for a delivery truck, with little
      downward-pointing triangles for wheels, but I didn’t have the
      book with me and I was having trouble remembering all the folds.
      As I reflattened the paper, the bell rang, and Arnold Ross,
      another friend from eighth grade, sat down next to me.  I
      expected him to say something about the origami, but instead he
      asked, “What happened to your hand?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I flexed my left hand and made the scar along the knuckles
      wiggle.  “I cut it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold, who usually has the loudest voice in the room,
      practically whispered his response.  “You <em>cut</em> it?  With
      a <em>blade?</em>”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was just pizza,” I said sheepishly.  “Two of the pieces were
      stuck together, you know, with the cheese,” and I pressed my
      hands against each other to demonstrate, “and I just was trying
      to cut them apart, and then Mom yelled at me, and startled me.
      It’s no big deal.”  I couldn’t tell if Arnold’s expression
      meant <i>you have impressed me</i> or <i>you have weirded me
      out</i>.
