<ul>
<li>Designed a simple encryption algorithm for generating and checking

license-key numbers; implemented it in Perl and InstallScript.
<li>As part of <a href="#cpp">C++ course</a>, implemented a very small

(including <tt>eq?</tt>,
<tt>eqv?</tt>,
<tt>number?</tt>,
<tt>symbol?</tt>,
<tt>boolean?</tt>,
<tt>pair?</tt>,
<tt>null?</tt>,

<tt>&lt;</tt>,
<tt>&gt;</tt>,
<tt>not</tt>,
<tt>cons</tt>,
<tt>car</tt>,
and <tt>cdr</tt>)
in C++.  Used the Singleton pattern
to implement the primitives and
Boolean values; used the Visitor pattern to implement run-time
type-checking (e.g., for the equality predicates).
<li>Wrote Perl scripts to reformat HTML pages generated by Quadralay
WebWorks, and to make bulk changes to FrameMaker templates in MIF
(Maker Interchange Format).
<li>Wrote Perl module, building on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/doc/DCONWAY/Parse-RecDescent-1.80/lib/Parse/RecDescent.pod">Parse::RecDescent</a> and
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/doc/SBURKE/Tree-DAG_Node-1.04/DAG_Node.pm">Tree::DAG_Node</a> modules, that parses MIF files.
<li>Maintained legacy Perl scripts that generate a class library reference
manual by walking through directories of C++ header and source files,
constructing tables of information about each class, and writing out
those tables as a MIF file.
<li>Maintained ColdFusion scripts on documentation intranet site.
<li>Maintained a Linux machine that serves other internal Web pages
(using Apache), internal netnews groups, and CVS.
<li>Helped administer and troubleshoot Documentum document management system.
