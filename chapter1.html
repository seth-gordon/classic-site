1.1 Mass Transport in Solids:  Fast Ionic Conduction</H3>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<p>In most solid state materials, ionic
conduction does not occur to any appreciable extent.  Defects in the crystal
lattice or large interstitial spaces, however, can provide empty sites
(vacancies) via which ions can migrate in a &#8220;hopping&#8221; mechanism,
wherein ions move sequentially into adjacent energy-equivalent empty sites. 
(Figure 1.1)  Cooperative motion of the ions also occurs.  At room temperature,
most ionic solids do not have enough vacancies to permit appreciable conduction
of ions.  However, when defect concentrations become high, as they do near the
material&#8217;s melting point, the ionic conductivity of the material
increases.  For example, NaCl, which is an insulator at room temperature, can
reach a conductivity of 10<SUP>-3</SUP> S cm<SUP>-1</SUP> at 800 <SUP>o</SUP>C,
just below the melting point of the material.  Doping aliovalent "impurities"
into the parent structure of a material creates vacancies on the opposite ionic
lattice to maintain charge electroneutrality.  In addition, some materials, such
as AgCl, accommodate ions in the interstitial space to compensate for vacancies
on the lattice (Frenkel defects), so that movement of ions from lattice sites to
interstitial sites and <I>vice-versa</I> provides a second potential mechanism
for mass transport.  (Figure 1.2)  In both of the examples given, it is the
cation that is the mobile species, although examples where anion Frenkel defects
provide the mode for mass transport are known (e.g. AgF).</p> <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Certain metal oxides, as well, experience
a gradual increase in defect concentration on the oxide sublattice as the sample
temperature rises, resulting in the potential for oxide ion conductivity. 
Oxides that crystallize in the fluorite structure, such as HfO<SUB>2</SUB>,
CeO<SUB>2</SUB>, ThO<SUB>2</SUB>, and stabilized zirconia have sufficient
unoccupied volume in the unit cell that anions can move into interstices.  These
materials can also accommodate a large concentration of lower-valent dopant
cations such as Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> and Y<SUP>3+</SUP> in their structures,
resulting in a high oxygen vacancy concentration and thus a high oxide ion
conductivity.  Zirconias can be doped with heterometals to maintain them in the
cubic fluorite structure, yielding, for instance, the industry standard oxide
ion conductor yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ).  They have conductivities on the
order of 5x10<SUP>-2</SUP> S cm<SUP>-1</SUP> at 1000 <SUP>o</SUP>C, and are
classified as &#8220;solid electrolytes.&#8221; </P><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<p>Solid electrolytes, also known as fast
ionic conductors or superionic conductors, are a class of materials with a
significantly higher low-temperature (below the material&#8217;s melting point)
conductivity than would be expected from a simple statistical assumption
regarding the number of vacancies.  In these materials, either a cationic or an
anionic component of the structure is not confined to specific lattice sites,
resulting in a high concentration of mobile species and a low activation energy
for ion migration.   As noted above, this situation may come about due to a
large interstitial volume native to the structure type, which accommodates ion
movement; or because of a large impurity concentration which produces extrinsic
vacancies on the lattice of the conducted species.  However, dopant ions and
vacancies tend to interact, and the extra energy required to overcome this
attraction increases the activation energy for conduction.  Therefore simply
doping a structure reaches a point beyond which further increases in dopant
concentration actually decrease the conductivity
realized.<SUP>1</SUP> <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>A high degree of intrinsic vacancy
disordering on the ionic sublattice, whether in the room temperature phase or in
a metastable high temperature phase, can also provide for fast ionic
conductivity because the random distribution of ions over an excess number of
sites having equal potential permits all of the ions on that sublattice to be
mobile, at least in principle.  For instance, disorder on both the cation and
oxygen sublattices of the pyrochlore (A<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>7</SUB>)
materials, where A and B may switch positions and O move into interstitial
sites, provides the high oxygen ion conductivities seen in these materials;
furthermore, the pyrochlore materials have a vacant oxygen site, when compared
with the closely-related fluorite structure AO<SUB>2</SUB>
(A<SUB>4</SUB>O<SUB>8</SUB>, compare with A<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>7</SUB>).<SUP>2</SUP> <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>A major goal of research in oxygen ion
conducting materials is the development of new compounds having high oxygen ion
conductivity at relatively low temperatures (400-800 <SUP>o</SUP>C), for use in
a number of different applications.  The design of new conductors attempts to
combine the extrinsic vacancies made through doping with the intrinsic vacancies
already in the parent structure.  The provision of a low activation energy
barrier for hopping between adjacent sites by using structures with a large free
volume and highly polarizable ions, is a second consideration. 
&#8220;Intergrowth&#8221; hybrids of known structures are possible.  For
example, while the perovskite structure (ABO<SUB>3</SUB>) is stoichiometric, it
accepts a large variation in A&#8217; and B&#8217; dopants, so that the net
compound
A<SUB>x</SUB>A&#8217;<SUB>1-x</SUB>B<SUB>y</SUB>B&#8217;<SUB>1-y</SUB>O<SUB>3-</SUB><SUB>delta</SUB>
can become oxygen-deficient and therefore conductive.  The Brownmillerite oxides
(A<SUB>2</SUB>B&#8217;B&#8221;O<SUB>5</SUB>) have essentially the perovskite
structure with ordered oxygen vacancies in alternate layers along the [101]
direction.  A number of examples of good oxygen ion conductivity above the
temperature of an order-disorder transition in the Brownmillerite family
exist.<SUP>3,4</SUP>  The Brownmillerites may be intergrown with perovskites to
produce hybrid oxygen ion conducting materials.<SUP>4,5</SUP>  Another
hybrid-type family, the Aurivillius<SUP>6</SUP> phases
(Bi<SUB>2</SUB>A<SUB>n-1</SUB>M<SUB>n</SUB>O<SUB>3n+3</SUB>) sandwich
perovskitic {A<SUB>n-1</SUB>M<SUB>n</SUB>O<SUB>3n+1</SUB>}<SUP>2-</SUP> regions
between sheets of {Bi<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>}<SUP>2+</SUP>.  Oxygen vacancies
in the perovskite region lead to the high conductivity reported for
Bi<SUB>2</SUB>WO<SUB>6</SUB> and Bi<SUB>2</SUB>VO<SUB>5.5</SUB>
(n=1).<SUP>7-10</SUP>  (Figure 1.3)  The intergrowth of Brownmillerite and
Aurivillius structures produced a new class of oxygen ion
conductors.<SUP>11</SUP></p><hr>

1.2  The BiMeVOx Family of Oxygen Ion Conductors</H3>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>It is the Aurivillius phases that have
given us materials with some of the highest oxygen-ion conductivities measured
to date.  These materials were first reported by Bush<SUP>12</SUP> and
Debreuille-Gresse.<SUP>7,13</SUP>  The solid-state synthesis is accomplished by
heating two equivalents of bismuth oxide, Bi<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>, with one
of vanadium pentoxide, V<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB>, to 600 <SUP>o</SUP>C,
followed by re-grinding of the pelletized sample and calcination at 850
<SUP>o</SUP>C in air.<SUP>14</SUP>  Two phase changes occur in the parent
structure on heating prior to congruent melting at 890 <SUP>o</SUP>C. (Equation
1.1)</p>




<b>1.1  alpha -> (450 <sup>o</sup>C) beta -> (570 <sup>o</sup>C) gamma</b><br>


<p>The
alpha phase, stable at
room temperature, has a face-centered orthorhombic mean cell, <B>a</B>=5.533(1),
<B>b</B>=5.611(1), <B>c</B>=15.288(4) &Aring;, by powder XRD.  Single-crystal
X-ray data were consistent with the powder data.  In the
beta phase, the mean
cell is tetragonal and some weak reflections indicate doubled cell parameters to
give <B>a</B>=<B>b</B>=11.285(8), <B>c</B>=15.400(9) &Aring; at 500
<SUP>o</SUP>C.  The
gamma phase is
tetragonal <B><I>I</I></B>4<I>/mmm</I> with parameters
<B>a</B>=<B>b</B>=4.004(1) and <B>c</B>=15.488(8) &Aring; at 700 <SUP>o</SUP>C. 
The X-ray data indicate a layered structure of
{Bi<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>}<SUP>2+ </SUP>sheets and perovskite-like slabs
similar to those found in Bi<SUB>2</SUB>MO<SUB>6</SUB> (M=W, Mo), but the cell
parameters and elemental composition indicate that the perovskite slabs are
incomplete.  While the O atoms in the puckered sheets are easily located, those
in the vanadium octahedra of the perovskitic regions are split among
high-multiplicity crystallographic sites.  There is a certain degree of debate
in the literature about the details of the structure, partially due to the
ambiguity introduced by the site disordering, and partially due to the
superlattice reflections observed by a number of authors.<SUP>15</SUP> 
 <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Whatever the particulars of the
structure, the overall formulation indicates vacancies and therefore high
oxygen-ion mobility in the perovskitic planes:
{Bi<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>}<SUP>2+</SUP>{VO<SUB>3.50.5</SUB>}<SUP>2-</SUP>
(where  is a vacancy).  The measured oxide-ion conductivities were indeed quite
high, and the transport number near unity.  Abraham&#8217;s report spurred a
flurry of other papers reporting various partial substitutions of other elements
for the Bi, V, or both metals in the structure, and the resulting modifications
to the ionic conductivity.<SUP>16,17</SUP> <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>The puckered
{Bi<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>}<SUP>2+</SUP> sheets have basal edge-shared
BiO<SUB>4</SUB> groups in which the Bi is at the apex of a square pyramid and
the four oxygen atoms form the base plane.  Partial substitution of the Bi with
Sb, Pb, and Te has been achieved but with no real improvement in the ionic
conductivity.<SUP>18-22</SUP>  The A and B sites of the perovskite block can be
substituted by a wide range of cations, provided that the perovskite and bismuth
oxide layers continue to match structurally.  Substitution of aliovalent cations
onto the vanadium sites can stabilize the high-temperature, high-conductivity
gamma phase to room
temperature, as well.  The collective term for the metal-substituted members of
this family is &#8220;BiMeVOx&#8221;, with the general formula
BiM<SUB>x</SUB>V<SUB>1-x</SUB>O<SUB>5.5-delta</SUB>. <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Further work by Abraham<SUP>14</SUP> led
to the initial members of the BiMeVOx family.  He doped the parent structure
with up to 12 atom% of Cu<SUP>2+</SUP> and found that for 0&lt;x&lt;0.07 in the
general formula above, the material is found in the orthorhomic
(alpha) phase, while for
0.07&lt;x&lt;0.12 the tetragonal
gamma phase is
stabilized to ambient temperature.  The formulation
Bi<SUB>2</SUB>Cu<SUB>0.1</SUB>V<SUB>0.9</SUB>O<SUB>5.35</SUB> was found to have
ionic conductivity (pressed pellet) of 1x10<SUP>-2</SUP> S cm<SUP>-1</SUP> at
300 <SUP>o</SUP>C, some three orders of magnitude greater than that of YSZ at
the same temperature.  (Figure 1.4)  Measurement of the conductivity of a single
crystal of the parent (undoped) material and of
Bi<SUB>2</SUB>Cu<SUB>0.1</SUB>V<SUB>0.9</SUB>O<SUB>5.35</SUB> demonstrated a
marked anisotropy, with the conductivity parallel to the
{Bi<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>}<SUP>2+</SUP> planes (crystallographic <I>ab</I>
plane) some 100 times higher than that perpendicular to the
{Bi<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>}<SUP>2+</SUP> planes (crystallographic <I>c</I>
plane).<SUP>23,24</SUP> This is consistent with the perovskitic layer&#8217;s
being primarily responsible for the ionic conduction.  The addition of the
dopant prevents the ordering of the metal positions and oxygen vacancies, and
permits the stabilization of the high-symmetry
gamma phase; the
disorder on these sites also provides the high conductivity observed in these
samples.  Substitution of Li<SUP>+</SUP>, Zn<SUP>2+</SUP>, and Ti<SUP>4+</SUP>,
at 10 atom%, all led to the stabilization of the
gamma structure to room
temperature, while use of Al<SUP>3+</SUP> and Ge<SUP>4+</SUP> did not lead to
the gamma
structure.<SUP>9</SUP> Surprisingly, the Ti-substituted materials showed the
highest conductivities in this set of compounds &#8211; higher, even, than for
the 10% Cu-doped compounds reported by Abraham.  This illustrates that
oxygen-ion vacancy concentration alone does not determine the ionic
conductivity.  The conductivity order among those ion substituents that
stabilized the gamma
structure is Ti<SUP>4+</SUP>&gt;Cu<SUP>2+</SUP> > >
Zn<SUP>2+</SUP>&gt;Li<SUP>+</SUP>, paralleling the order of the ability of the
cation to polarize anions.  The authors suggest that the polarization of the
oxygen ions somehow &#8220;eases&#8221; the hopping of oxide ions from filled
sites to vacant sites.  Among 4+ cation substituents Pb, Zr, Sn, and Ti, the
conductivity increased with decreasing ionic radius,<SUP>25</SUP> as expected
from the model developed by Cherry et al. for migration of oxygen ions in
perovskite-type oxides.<SUP>26</SUP>  The conductivities of the BiMeVOx
materials and the quantity of dopant required for their stabilization in the
gamma phase are listed
in Tables 1.1 and 1.2.<SUP>27</SUP> <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>The coordination geometry around the
dopant cation is, similarly, important.  Substitution of Sb(V) and Nb(V) into
the parent structure to generate
Bi<SUB>2</SUB>M<SUB>0.3</SUB>V<SUB>0.7</SUB>O<SUB>5.5</SUB> (M=Sb, Nb)
stabilizes the tetragonal phase and gives materials with conductivities
comparable to or slightly better than BiCuVOx and BiTiVOx.<SUP>28</SUP> However,
the conductivity of the Sb-substituted material is higher than for the
Nb-substituted material, and this appears to be correlated with the regular
octahedral geometry around the Sb, <I>versus</I> the off-center positioning of
Nb in its coordination octahedron, as well as with the polarizability of Sb
relative to that of Nb.  The distorted and oxygen-deficient surroundings of the
Nb may act as a trapping area during anionic diffusion, thereby lowering the
conductivity.  In Cr(III)-doped samples, the tendency for Cr(III) to adopt a
full regular octahedral coordination and form clusters seems to be associated
with the rise the number of tetrahedrally coordinated V(V) in the
lattice.<SUP>29</SUP>  This clustering, as well as the increase in the number of
unfavorable tetrahedral V(V) sites, may cause the poor oxide ion conductivity of
Cr(III)-doped samples.  Conversely, in the high-conductivity Cu-doped BiCuVOx,
EPR and UV-VIS spectroscopic data suggest that the Cu<SUP>2+</SUP> sites are
distorted-octahedral, with the oxygen atoms compressed along the apical
direction.<SUP>30</SUP> <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Most of this discussion must be taken
with somewhat of a grain of salt, however, since cations of suitable charge and
size may substitute onto either the Bi or V sites.  West et al. demonstrates
that three or four mechanisms of accommodating the aliovalent cations may take
place: V <-> Bi, V <-> M, Bi <-> M, and possibly interstitial M.
<SUP>31,32</SUP>  Double substitutions, either of two different metals for V or
of heterometals on the V and Bi sites, have been reported.  These failed to give
an improvement in conductivity over the BiCuVOx standard, and the authors report
that the resulting solid solutions are metastable.<SUP>22</SUP>  The
questionable nature of the assumption that all the dopants introduced are going
into given sites may account for the variation among reports of the minimum
dopant levels required to stabilize the
gamma
phase.<SUP>23,31,33</SUP> <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>The high oxide ion conductivity reported
for the BiMeVOx family is believed to be due to the disorder of the oxygen
vacancies that are associated with the vanadium atoms in the perovskitic layer. 
Mairesse has summarized results for the substitutions of various metal cations
onto the vanadium site.<SUP>17</SUP>  The highest conductivities are found for
BiCuVOx, BiTiVOx, and BiNbVOx; doping with other metals results in compounds
with lower oxide ion conductivities, though in all doped materials the
conductivities are still higher than in the undoped parent phase.  (Figure
1.5) <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>All told, the BiMeVOx family of
materials, with their exceptionally high oxygen ion conductivity at low
temperatures, have been extensively studied and show potential for a number of
applications.  However, because the electronic transport number has been shown
to be at least a few percent (<I>t</I><SUB>i</SUB>=0.987 at 557
<SUP>o</SUP>C),<SUP>34</SUP> these materials cannot be used in devices where
electrical &#8220;shorting&#8221; of the circuit is detrimental: e.g. in oxygen
sensors and fuel cells.  For other applications, the presence of some electronic
conductivity is beneficial.  Bi<SUB>2</SUB>VO<SUB>5.5</SUB> and BiMeVOx (Me=Cu,
Fe, Sr) have also been tested as catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane
(<I>vide infra</I>). <SUP>35</SUP>

will include a 1/T dependence as well).   <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV>

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Thus a plot of

will give a line of slope -E<SUB>a</SUB>.  Over a range of temperatures this
plot may have regions of different activation energies corresponding to
different sources (extrinsic or intrinsic) of the conductivity
observed. <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>While the electrical conductivity of
materials can be measured directly by imposing a dc current and measuring the
voltage drop across the material according Ohm&#8217;s law, the measurement of
ionic conductivity is not so straightforward.  Imposition of a dc voltage across
an ion-conducting solid will result in an initial current which will be the sum
of the ion current and any electronic current.  Because many electrode materials
are blocking to the ions being conducted, the solid will become polarized over
time and the voltage will drop to zero.  Thus the ionic conductor behaves as a
capacitor when blocking electrodes are used.  One solution to the problem of
making the conductivity measurement is, of course, to use an electrode that
permits conduction of both electrons and the mobile ions; however, such
electrodes are not available for all materials. <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<p>A second commonly used alternative is to
impose an ac voltage oscillating at a range of different frequencies, and
measure the impedance (or the admittance; the equations cited below are for the
impedance).  A Wheatstone bridge type of apparatus is used, where for impedance
measurements the resistive and capacitative circuit elements are in series. 
Gold or platinum blocking electrodes are typical, and the interface between the
electrode and the sample therefore adds a double-layer capacitance in series
with the simple bulk resistance and with the resistance due to grain boundary
effects (the latter is seen in polycrystalline samples only).  Each of these
sample resistances has a capacitance in parallel with it, and the electronic
resistance of the sample is parallel the ionic resistances and capacitances. 
(Figure 1.6)  Because the apparatus measures only the composite R and C values
the sample is a sort of &#8220;black box,&#8221; so that the interpretation of
ac impedance or admittance measurements to yield R and C values for each of the
circuit components is somewhat of an art. <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<p>According to Ohm&#8217;s law,
I=ER<SUP>-1</SUP> and is frequency-independent for direct current passing

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Ohm&#8217;s law can also be written in
terms of impedance, Z, as Z=E(t)/I(t), where E(t) = E<SUB>m</SUB> sin
  w t and I(t) =
I<SUB>m</SUB> sin
(  w t+  phi ).
Since the total voltage drop across a circuit containing resistive and
capacitive elements is a simple sum of the voltage drops across each element,
E=E<SUB>R</SUB> + E<SUB>C</SUB>; the total impedance for such a circuit is given
by Equation 1.6: <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT">(1.6)  Z = R +
1/j  w C = R -
j/  w C. <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The impedance of a parallel RC circuit is
given by Equation 1.7.  After some algebra, this separates into real and
imaginary parts as in Equations 1.8a-b.  Elimination of the frequency
  w  gives the equation
of a circle with its center at (R/2, 0) and radius R/2.  (Equation 1.9)  Thus,
when the imaginary part Z&#8221; of the complex impedance is plotted against the
real part Z&#8217;, each parallel RC circuit gives rise to a semicircle in the
Z* plane and each series RC element gives a vertical line in this plane. 
(Figure 1.7)  The R value of each circuit element is the intersection of either
the line or the semi-circle with the Z&#8217; axis.  The maximum of the
semicircle occurs such that
  w RC=1.  When the
frequencies are not sufficiently far apart, the semi-circles often overlap, so
that some curve-fitting is necessary to deduce the locations of the useful
points in the Z* plane.  (Figure 1.7)  The overall sample resistance will be the
sum of the bulk and grain boundary resistance.  As shown in Figure 1.7, the zero
intercept of the net arc is this sum.  Furthermore, since the electrodes are
normally blocking for the ion conducted, their frequency response curve is a
line inclined at a slope of
  pi /4 to the
horizontal (Z&#8217;) axis, and thus may be distinguished easily from the
material&#8217;s resistances.  Closer analysis of the data can differentiate the
contributions to the total conductivity of the current carrier concentration and
the rates of ion hopping from site to site.<SUP>38</SUP>  As the number of
circuit elements increases, the expressions for Z&#8217; and Z&#8221; become
increasingly complicated, so that the circuit in Figure 1.7 would have the

1.4.1 Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs)</H4>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<p>In a fuel cell two electrodes are
separated by an electrolyte, which in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is the
oxide ion conducting ceramic.  Fuels such as hydrogen (fed directly or produced
<I>in situ</I> by hydrocarbon reforming) or carbon monoxide are fed to the anode
where they are oxidized, releasing electrons to an external circuit.  On the
cathode side, oxygen fed into the SOFC unit is reduced by the electrons arriving
through the external circuit.  (Figure 1.8)  The electron flow through the
external circuit produces dc electricity at an open-circuit voltage which can be
derived from the Gibbs energy expression for the chemical reaction taking place
combined with Faraday&#8217;s law.  The actual closed-circuit voltage falls off
with increasing current density and power as more and more chemical potential is
converted to heat rather than to electrical energy.<SUP>44</SUP>  However,
because a fuel cell converts chemical potential directly into electrical work
without going though the intermediate of heat, as in steam turbine-based
electrical generators, its conversion efficiency is not Carnot-limited.  To
build up to the desired voltage, single fuel cell units are arranged as a stack
and connected in series or in parallel or in a combination of the two, depending
on the application.  Compared with traditional steam-turbine generators, fuel
cells are also higher in efficiency at partial load,<SUP>44</SUP> may be
constructed modularly on virtually any site, and are less polluting.  Ceramic
fuel cells &#8211; SOFCs &#8211; have been constructed for multikillowatt
applications and operated for thousands of hours; they offer a number of
benefits over other types of fuel cells.<SUP>45</SUP>   <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT">One of the difficulties with SOFCs,
however, is that maintaining the high operating temperature (1000 <SUP>o</SUP>C)
required for sufficient ionic conductivity in the electrolyte (usually
stabilized zirconia<SUP>45</SUP>), uses up some of the energy benefit realized
by the greater theoretical efficiency.  Furthermore, the operating conditions
put stringent requirements on the other materials (anode, cathode,
interconnects) to be used in the cell.  The other materials to be used must be
stable and compatible with each other at high temperatures.  While temperatures
over 600 <SUP>o</SUP>C are desirable to permit <I>in situ</I> hydrocarbon fuel
reforming, it is also preferable to be able to operate the fuel cell at
temperatures less than 800 <SUP>o</SUP>C to reduce the material-based problems
associated with other cell components.  Some research<SUP>11,
15,</SUP><SUP>16,46</SUP> has sought to develop new materials that exhibit high
oxide ion conductivities below 800 <SUP>o</SUP>C, while having other desirable
properties such as low cost and stability over a wide range of temperatures and
oxygen partial pressures, many present-day technologies seek simply to reduce
the thickness of the YSZ solid electrolyte.  By reducing the path length for
oxide ion conduction, such electrolyte films or membranes can increase the
effective oxygen flux at a given temperature.<br><hr><B><a href="figure-1-8.gif">Figure 1.8:</a>  Solid oxide fuel

to ionic motion and developed the equation that bears his name to quantify it:  
E=kT/4q ln (PO<SUB>2</SUB>&#8217;/PO<SUB>2</SUB>&#8221;), where
PO<SUB>2</SUB>&#8221; and PO<SUB>2</SUB>&#8217; are the oxygen partial pressures
on either side of the sample.  This development of electrical potential can be
measured and used to determine the oxygen partial pressure in an unknown gas
mixture, if that in a reference gas is known. <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<p>In automobile emissions control
equipment, for example, the exhaust from the engine is passed over a
platinum-containing catalyst downstream of the engine.  For efficient operation
of the catalytic converter, the fuel-to-air ratio must be kept near 0.07 over
the entire range of driving conditions.<SUP>2</SUP>  A feedback circuit enabling
constant adjustment of the fuel injection system employs an oxygen sensor in
which a yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) oxide-ion conductor is exposed on one
side to the exhaust gas stream and on the other to a reference gas of known
oxygen content (air).  (Figure 1.9)  The difference in oxygen partial pressures
on either side of the YSZ barrier produces an electrical potential difference
across the YSZ according to the Nernst equation.  However, because many oxide
ion conductors are partially &#8220;shorted out&#8221; by some electronic
conduction, the actual voltage falls below the Nernst potential (Equation

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Oxide ion conducting ceramics proposed

operating temperature of YSZ-based sensors is over 800 <SUP>o</SUP>C, while a
desirable operating temperature is lower, in the 200-400 <SUP>o</SUP>C range. 
Thus methods of lowering the operating temperature of these units, either by
finding new oxide ion conductive materials that satisfy the requirements, or by
using thin films or membranes of known conductive materials, are being sought.

1.4.3 Air Separators</H4>
<p>The situation of oxygen pumping is essentially the reverse of the oxygen
sensing: an applied voltage E produces an oxygen partial pressure difference on
either side of a solid electrolyte, in accordance with the Nernst equation.
(Equation 1.11)  A device designed to take advantage of this may be used to
separate oxygen out of air or specialty gases to obtain, for example,
oxygen-free nitrogen or argon.  In other cases, the pure oxygen is the desired
product of the separation process, frequently to be used in chemical oxidation
processes or industrial combustion or oxidation processes, or in health-related
industries.
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Cryogenic distillation is the preferred
process, currently, for large-scale (50-2000 tons/day) production of high-purity
(&gt;95%) oxygen.  Contaminants in the compressed air feed, such as water,
carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons, must be removed prior to the distillation to
prevent blockage of heat exchangers and hazardous waste buildup in the
distillation column sump.<SUP>48</SUP>  Removal of these contaminants is
expensive both in terms of the extra capital equipment requirement and the
energy requirements.  Crude argon (1% in air) is one product of the cryogenic
air separation process.  At this stage it contains some 2-7% oxygen, which must
be removed prior to the argon&#8217;s use in inert atmosphere applications; but
because of the proximity of the boiling point of argon (87.28 K) and oxygen
(90.19 K), further purification of the argon by distillation is extremely
uneconomical.  Currently, oxygen contamination in crude argon streams is reduced
to the ppm level by reduction to water using excess hydrogen over a platinum
catalyst, followed by drying and distillation to remove water, hydrogen, and
nitrogen contaminants.<SUP>49</SUP>  In addition to the expense of using
hydrogen in this way, the drying and distillation steps introduce large capital
and operating costs into the purification process.  A number of cyclic
adsorption/desorption processes for removing oxygen from argon are also reported
in the patent literature.<SUP>50</SUP>  <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>An air separator constructed from a pore-
and defect-free oxide-ion conductor, on the other hand, is completely
permselective for oxygen, and offers significant advantages over air separation
methods based on conventional technology.<SUP>51,52</SUP>  The feed stock may be
crude argon,<SUP>53</SUP> air, or the hot exhaust from a combustion
process.<SUP>52,54</SUP>  Application of an electrical potential difference
across the ionic conducting ceramic will &#8220;pump&#8221; oxide ions against
an unfavorable concentration gradient at a reasonable rate to induce
separation.<SUP>52</SUP>  Air separator designers prefer to have concomitant
electrical and ionic conduction (t<SUB>ionic</SUB> &lt; 1), as this situation
makes it unnecessary to have an external circuit prevent charge buildup on the
membrane.  Potential losses associated with the ohmic resistance of the
electrolyte and electrodes, in addition to nonohmic rate processes such as
charge transfer, adsorption, and slow gas phase and surface diffusion of oxygen
and oxide ions, cause the actual applied potential to exceed the theoretical
(Nernst) potential required to achieve a given PO<SUB>2</SUB>.<SUP>55</SUP> 
Furthermore, air separators must be operated at temperatures at or above 800
<SUP>o</SUP>C where the ceramic material, typically YSZ, has sufficient ionic
conduction to be useful.<SUP>56</SUP>  Both of these problems have clear
associated costs, driving research into improving oxygen pump/air separator
efficiencies.  One approach to the problem is the development of low-temperature
(200-400 <SUP>o</SUP>C) oxide ion conducting
materials.<SUP>11,15,</SUP><SUP>16,46</SUP>  For instance, Dumelie et al. used a
highly conductive solid solution, called beta
(sigma  at 600 <SUP>o</SUP>C = 1 S cm<SUP>-1</SUP>),
in the Bi<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>-PbO system as a pressed pellet
&#8220;membrane&#8221; some 4 mm thick to take advantage of the high
conductivity of this material compared with YSZ.<SUP>56</SUP>  They found that
the air separator performance declined after a few operating hours as grain
coarsening and the development of orientation in the pellet caused cracks. 
 <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>A second approach to improving the
performance of solid electrolyte air separators is to fabricate the oxide ion
conductive material as a thin film or membrane.  The resulting decrease in the
conduction path will result in a corresponding increase in the total oxygen flux
realizable at a given temperature, as well as decreasing the required
overpotential. <BR></DIV>

1.4.4 Catalytic Inorganic Membrane Reactors</H4>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<p>The ability to include in-line air
separation in a chemical process is particularly attractive for designers of
catalytic inorganic membrane reactors (CIMRs) for partial oxidation reactions. 
Partial oxidation reactions are among the most widespread in use in industry,
and lead to a number of important organic intermediates.  (Table 1.3)  The
current technology for performing these reactions on an industrial scale uses
the standard fixed-bed reactor design in which a mixture of reagent and inert
gases flow over a heterogeneous catalyst; air or oxygen is injected at the
outset of the reactor flow and possibly at intermediate points.  Reactant
profiles tend to decrease monotonically with distance from oxygen (air) inlets
and the selectivity for the desired partial oxidation product is low near the
inlet due to complete oxidation in this high-PO<SUB>2</SUB> area.  The organic
materials must be diluted to below explosive concentrations with inert gases to
ensure safety.  Such diluent gases or air (as opposed to pure oxygen) create an
additional need for downstream separation processes. <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>The potential benefits of using a
membrane reactor geometry, where components of the feed stock are kept separated
by a barrier permselective to oxygen are clear.  In plants where pure oxygen is
the desired reagent, a membrane reactor setup eliminates the need for off-line
cryogenic air separation.  The ability to add oxygen continually and gradually
to the reagent stream can increase conversion rates and will increase the
selectivity for the desired partial oxidation products.  Modulation of oxygen
injection by varying the partial pressure or electrical overpotential gives a
finer reaction control than is realizable with a finite-point injection design. 
Finally, the ability to &#8220;leak&#8221; in oxygen permits the use of pure
(undiluted) feedstocks and reduces the downstream separator load.  While
polymer-based membrane reactors were used in biotechnology applications during
the 1970s and 1980s, catalytic <I>inorganic</I> membrane reactors were not used
until the mid-1980s, when methods of fabrication became sufficiently
well-advanced.<SUP>57</SUP>  Commercialization of such reactor geometries was
first accomplished in 1991.<SUP>58</SUP>  Initial work focused on the oxidative
coupling of methane (OCM) to ethene or higher (C<SUB>2+</SUB>) products, on
partial oxidation to methanol or formaldehyde, or on methane conversion to
synthesis gas (&#8220;syngas,&#8221; CO + H<SUB>2</SUB>), which is then
converted via Fischer-Tropsch technology to higher-value products&#8212; because
the high temperatures required for methane activation (&gt; 600 <SUP>o</SUP>C)
are also required by YSZ for achieving a reasonable oxygen
flux. <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<p>Large worldwide reserves of methane make
it an inexpensive gas to obtain and increase the potential economic benefit of a
system of converting it to higher value products.  The selectivity of conversion
of methane to ethane, then to ethylene, is determined by the rate at which
oxygen is made available to the reagent stream.  Selectivity &#8211; avoidance
of losses of carbon into low-value CO<SUB>x</SUB> &#8211; is more important
economically than is achieving a high raw yield.<SUP>59</SUP>  The best
catalytic reactors offer 20% conversion at 80% selectivity for
C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>4</SUB> and C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>6</SUB>.<SUP>60</SUP>  The use
of steam reforming to convert methane to syngas, followed by conversion to
C<SUB>2+</SUB> products via Fischer-Tropsch processes, is energy and capital
intensive; syngas production by steam reforming accounts for upwards of 60% of
the integrated cost of a plant.<SUP>60</SUP>  Some 40% of the capital investment
goes into the air separation and syngas generation
equipment.<SUP>61</SUP> <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>	A  process using a dense solid
electrolyte hollow-tube reactor packed with an Rh-based catalyst achieved up to
99% conversion with 90-95% CO and H<SUB>2</SUB> selectivity.  The tube reactor
(Figure 1.10) was cast from a perovskite in the La-Sr-Fe-Co-O system (a mixed
conductor) and was 0.25-1.20 mm thick; it was operated at 800 <SUP>o</SUP>C for
up to 500 h.<SUP>60</SUP>   Work at British Petroleum using both the
La-Sr-Fe-Co-Cr-O perovskites and an
In<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>/PrO<SUB>2</SUB>-doped zirconia gave similar results
for a range of reaction geometries.  There, the focus was on making thinner
solid electrolyte membranes for achieving the same flux at lower temperatures,
and on improving fabrication processes for the membranes, rather than on
examining new materials which may give higher fluxes at still-high
temperatures.<SUP>61</SUP> <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Other processes using CIMRs have been
reported.  DiCosimo reports and patents a process for oxidative
dehydrodimerization of propylene over a
Bi<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>-La<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> oxide-ion conductive
catalytic membrane some 0.5 mm thick in a counterflow reactor operated at 600
<SUP>o</SUP>C.<SUP>62,63</SUP>  However, he found that he needed to add oxygen
(1% by volume) to the propylene feedstock to stabilize the membrane against
Bi<SUP>3+</SUP> reduction to the metal, and had a conversion rate to
C<SUB>3</SUB> dimers of less than 5% of the propylene, with selectivity near 50%
for C<SUB>3</SUB> dimers.  A later patent discloses a 5-300
  mu m-thick dense

700-900 <SUP>o</SUP>C for OCM at conversions of 10-50% of methane

catalyst) with C<SUB>2+</SUB> selectivity of over 50%.<SUP>64</SUP>  The patent
also claims partial oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide and propylene to
propylene oxide or acrylonitrile over assorted catalysts, also with high
conversion rates (&gt; 20%) and selectivities (&gt;50%) at lower temperatures. 
The permselectivity of YSZ to oxygen has also been used to shift the equilibrium
of the decomposition of CO<SUB>2</SUB> to CO +
O<SUB>2</SUB>.<SUP>65</SUP> <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>	As the discussion above indicates, there
is an interest in partial oxidation reactions which must be run in the 200-600
<SUP>o</SUP>C range, below the temperatures where a reasonable oxygen flux can
be expected from traditional YSZ electrolytes.  All of the reactions in Table
1.3, except for those involving methane, are best run at 270-500 <SUP>o</SUP>C;
higher temperatures result in excessive oxidation to CO<SUB>x</SUB>.  While some
work has accomplished these partial oxidations in CIMRs by making thinner YSZ
membranes and by adding Bi<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> dopants to provide for
electronic conduction so that oxygen pumping increases the activity of partial
oxidation catalysts,<SUP>57,66</SUP> conversion numbers are still
low.<SUP>57</SUP>  The oxygen flux achievable through a 1-mm thickness 8%
Y<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>-doped zirconia is 10<SUP>-11</SUP> mol
cm<SUP>-2</SUP>&#160;s<SUP>-1</SUP> at 800 <SUP>o</SUP>C and La-Sr-Mn-O
perovskite systems can achieve 10<SUP>-10</SUP> mol cm<SUP>-2</SUP>
s<SUP>-1</SUP> at the same temperature.  This creates quite a limitation on the
conversion reaction.<SUP>57</SUP> <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>The largest hurdles faced in the
construction of commercially useful CIMRs include<SUP>67</SUP> (1) improvement
of the oxygen fluxes available at the temperatures desired for the partial
oxidation reactions, (2) prevention of cracking during thermal cycling, (3)
design issues including how to seal the membrane into existing plant components
or how to fabricate a standalone membrane reactor unit, (4) matching the oxygen
supply rates to the reaction rates to optimize yield and selectivity, and (5)
issues of heat transfer.  While several of these points are chemical engineering
problems, the initial advances must be made in the area of materials chemistry. 
New mixed oxygen-ion/electronic conductors with good material strength and high
flux at lower temperatures need to be developed; methods of fabricating a
defect-free membrane either as a supported film or as a standalone design are
vital.<br><hr><B>Table 1.3: Industrial Partial Oxidation

1.4.5 Expected Benefits of Use of BiMeVOx Compounds</H4>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<p>The devices described above all suffer
from the need to be operated at high temperatures (&gt; 600 <SUP>o</SUP>C) to
achieve economic oxygen fluxes.  While part of the solution to the problem
involves reducing the length of the conduction path by fabrication of thinner
membranes of the solid electrolyte atop porous supports to provide the proper
structural integrity, there is a natural limit to how thin membranes can become
before pinholes and other defects become technically unavoidable.<SUP>57</SUP> 
Thus, the thinner-membrane approach is best combined with the use of novel
materials with higher oxide ion conductivities.  The BiMeVOx materials, with
some of the highest oxygen-ion conductivities, are not appropriate for all the
devices discussed above due to their concomitant electronic conductivity, which
increases as the bismuth in the lattice is reduced to the metal over long-term
use at very low PO<SUB>2</SUB>.  Still, the BiMeVOx compounds can be useful for
oxygen pumps and air separators, and for CIMRs.  Fabricated as membranes, they
can be extremely powerful.  For comparison, a 1 cm<SUP>2</SUP> area of a 1
mm-thick membrane of YSZ operated at 500 <SUP>o</SUP>C has an expected oxygen
flux of 2.3x10<SUP>-12</SUP> mol cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> while under the
same conditions a BiCuVOx membrane gives 2.3x10<SUP>-7</SUP> mol cm<SUP>-2</SUP>
s<SUP>-1</SUP> oxygen flux.  For 1
  mu m films, the flux
jumps to 2.3x10<SUP>-9</SUP> mol cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> and
2.3x10<SUP>-4</SUP> mol cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> for YSZ and BiCuVOx,
respectively.<SUP>69</SUP> <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<p>In addition to the benefits realizable
due to the BiMeVOx phases&#8217; high low-temperature oxide ion conductivity,
these materials are expected to be catalytically active in partial oxidation
reactions, so that in a CIMR including a BiMeVOx membrane, the membrane may
contribute to the catalysis.  In general, metal oxides, especially mixed oxygen
ion/electronic conductors, are superior to metals as catalysts for partial
oxidation reactions.<SUP>57,67</SUP>  The active sites on the catalyst are
variously thought to be oxygen vacancies with local migration of electrons to or
away from these sites<SUP>70</SUP> or lattice oxygen near the surface.  Adsorbed
oxygen is responsible for nonselective reactions on the surface of the
catalyst.<SUP>71</SUP>  The most active catalysts are able to cycle between two
valence states and thereby store and release oxygen.  Ready incorporation of
oxygen into the lattice minimizes the adsorbed (non-selective) oxygen
species. <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Bismuth-containing species, particularly
those based on the scheelite structure, are known to be active partial oxidation
catalysts.  The scheelite structure (named for the mineral CaWO<SUB>4</SUB>) is
tetragonal AMX<SUB>4</SUB> with tetrahedral (MX<SUB>4</SUB>)<SUP>n-</SUP> units
and A<SUP>n+</SUP> cations.  It is not a layered or chainlike structure.  Anion
vacancies exist in the scheelite structure and oxygen ion mobility is
significant in many of the bismuth-containing scheelites.<SUP>72</SUP>  The
scheelite polymorph of bismuth orthovanadate, BiVO<SUB>4</SUB> has been found to
have low but measurable mixed conduction which is accounted to anion
vacancies.<SUP>73-75</SUP>  It is catalytically active for OCM, though the
bismuth molybdates are more commonly used due to their higher
activity.<SUP>67,72</SUP>  Tests of the Aurivillius phases
Bi<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>(A<SUB>n-1</SUB>B<SUB>n</SUB>O<SUB>3n+1</SUB>), A=
Ca, Sr, Ba, Pb; B=Nb, Ta; n=2-4 showed that these materials are selective and
stable in the OCM reaction.<SUP>76</SUP>  Direct tests on the BiMeVOx family
show a correlation between methane conversion and oxygen conductivity, and for
M=Fe, Cu, Sr doping at 10 mol%, the C<SUB>2</SUB> selectivity
increases.<SUP>35</SUP>  In all these cases the catalyst was used in a
packed-bed reactor geometry. <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>	In partial oxidation systems other than
OCM, the bismuth-containing scheelite catalysts are effective, and their
activity and selectivity increases with increasing vacancy
concentration,<SUP>72</SUP> which leads to increased oxygen ion mobility.  On
the other hand, catalysts with vacancies but no bismuth in the lattice have high
isomerization activity and low oxidation activity for olefin oxidation or
coupling; so while bismuth is not directly involved in the first step of olefin
oxidation, it is relevant for selective oxidation of the allyl
intermediate.<SUP>72</SUP>  Furthermore, catalysts containing bismuth are
re-oxidized more readily than those that have no bismuth.  The evidence
suggests, then, that the BiMeVOx family promises at least some catalytic
activity in partial oxidation applications, so that a membrane fabricated from
BiMeVOx for use in a CIMR would have a dual function of permselectivity and
catalytic activity. <BR></DIV>

1.5 Conclusions and Project Goals</H3>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>While the electronic conductivity of the
BiMeVOx family of oxygen-ion conductors prevents them from being useful in fuel
cell and oxygen sensor applications, this same property is desirable in air
separation and CIMR technology.  In both cases there is a industrial strong
interest in lowering the temperatures presently required for economical oxygen
fluxes (600-900 <SUP>o</SUP>C).  The high oxygen conductivity at low
temperatures (200-600 <SUP>o</SUP>C) characteristic of some members of the
BiMeVOx family can be used in combination with fabrication of these materials as
membranes or thin films to obtain very high oxygen fluxes.  Furthermore, the
experience with bismuth-based oxide catalysts suggests that BiMeVOx membranes
may be catalytically active in appropriate devices.  It is vital that these
films be defect-free so that the permselectivity is uncompromised, and that they
be able to maintain their integrity in reducing conditions during thermal
cycling. <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>The practical goal of the research
described in Part I of this thesis was to produce defect-free thin films
(&lt;1-10   mu m thick
on a porous support) of BiMeVOx solid oxide conductors, test and verify their
oxide ion conductivity, and use them &#8211; in collaboration with the Ying

films onto porous alumina substrates.  Further progress was checked by the
termination of the project. <BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><p>The succeeding chapters describe the
deposition of BiMeVOx films onto a number of substrates using pulsed laser
deposition (Chapter Two) and two sol-gel based methods of preparing a
film-castable precursor (Chapters Three and Four).  Characterization of the
precursor solution is reported in Chapter Five.  Film-casting onto non-porous
and porous substrates, finally, is described (Chapter Six).  Because much of the
work described relies on techniques and ideas often outside the purvey of
traditional chemistry, each chapter includes, where appropriate, a brief
introductory review of the relevant material.  This part of the thesis will
conclude with a discussion of future directions and usefulness of this work
(Chapter Seven). <BR></DIV> <hr><b><a href="figure-1-10.gif">Figure 1.10:</a>  Tube type CIMR for oxidative dehydrodimerization of propylene.</b><hr>
